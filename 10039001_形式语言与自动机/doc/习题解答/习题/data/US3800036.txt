ICE MILK OR LOW FAT IMITATION ICE CREAM CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 153,837 filed June 16, 1971, which in turn is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Pat. application Ser. No. 74,211 filed Sept. 21, 1970 and now abandoned.
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention involves frozen desserts including ice milk, imitation ice cream of both the soft and hard varieties, and imitation ice cream shakes. In preferred embodiments the products have low fat content and are designed to have the appearance and taste of soft or hard ice cream, an ice cream shake, or ice milk, but to supply substantially reduced food energy than the corresponding ice cream product in like amount.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The compositions of the present invention are denominated ice milks or low fat imitation ice creams since some embodiments thereof comply with the standards of identity of regulatory agencies for products of this type with respect to manner of preparation and ingredients and other embodiments have lower fat contents yet resemble those products in organoleptic qualities and appearance. The discovery has been made that ice milks and low fat imitation ice creams of improved gustatory quality may be prepared by employing a polyglycerol fatty ester as texturizing ingredient in an amount constituting but a small portion on a weight basis of the amount of fat replaced or contained in a conventional ice cream or shake of comparable quality.
The polyglycerol esters have been known for many years having been first described in the chemical literature as early as 1930. Edible grades have been widely used in margarine manufacture as anti-spattering ingredients and in the preparation of shortening compositions for use in the preparation of confections and pastries because of their emulsifying qualities. Refer for example to U.S. Pat. No. 3,230,909 and Belgian Pat. No. 636,949 dated June 10, 1965 (Chemical Abstracts, 65, 6204d). They have also been used as emulsifying agents in gelatin desserts and in whipped toppings. Refer to Brunner et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,592,663 (patented July 13, 1971) and Wyss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,579,355 (patented May 18, 1971).
The Brunner et al. patent refers to fluffy frosting compositions intended for use on cakes, candy, ice cream, and as a filling for baked items. They are comprised essentially of sugar, water, and a foaming agent, and are whipped to provide compositions of very low specific gravity, namely less than 0.3. The products depend for their unusual quality as cake frostings upon the hydrophilic/lipophilic character of specific polyglycerol esters having a high proportion of fatty ester groups having 22 carbon atoms or more.
The Wyss et al. patent refers to gelatin dessert compositions which separate into two or three layers on constitution with warm water and cooling to provide an unusual layered gelatin dessert. Neither the Brunner et al. nor the Wyss et al. product contains milk solids or a protein and carbohydrate substitute therefor, but
2
rather they are comprised mainly of sugar, gelatin, and water. The latter depends for layer formation on specific combinations of fat and emulsifiers and employs lesser amounts of polyglycerol ester than are employed in the compositions of the present invention.
The prior art has also dealt with the preparation of imitation ice cream containing milk solids or substitutes therefore and fat, but not through the use of a polyglycerol ester as texturizing ingredient. Refer for example to Diamond U.S. Pat. No. 2,619,422. A mixed partial fatty glyceride is used as stabilizer in the Diamond compositions.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present compositions are fat-free or low fat frozen desserts having exceptional qualities of texture, mouth feel, stability, and flavor. In these respects the products resemble high fat frozen desserts such as ice cream, but in fact they have a low fat content corresponding to that of ice milk or sherbert, and preferred embodiments which are virtually indistinguishable from ice cream contain no triglyceride fat ingredient. The hard frozen desserts of this invention preferably have less than 65 percent of the calories of ice cream containing 10 percent fat and, of course, an even smaller fraction of the calories of rich ice creams which contain 16 percent fat. They generally provide from about 90 to about 155 Calories of food energy per serving weighing 100 g. Shakes typically supply about 100 Calories/100 g., and hard ice creams about 112 Calories/lOOg.
The present frozen desserts have specific gravities similar to those of ice cream, ice milk, or an ice cream shake within the range of 0.45 to 0.73, and preferably
0.50 to 0.60. They preferably contain at least 6 percent milk solids and from 20 to 40 percent of total solids including the fat and milk solids and sugar when used as sweetening ingredient. Artifical sweeteners may be used. The frozen desserts contain 60 to 80 percent of water, all or a portion of which may conveniently be supplied as a dairy ingredient such as low fat skim milk, or concentrated skim milk. The products are preferably frozen while stirring to aerate or incorporate an inert gas to provide from 50 to 125 percent overrun in accordance with the usual practice in the ice cream making art. The most commonly used overrun is about 90 percent.
The key ingredient which confers the qualities of texture, stability, flavor, and mouth feel upon the products of the present invention which qualities have formerly been associated with the fat ingredient in frozen desserts, is a polyglycerol fatty ester present in an amount from 0.5 to 1.5 percent by weight of the finished product. The preferred polyglycerol ester for use in the present invention is triglycerol monostearate (Drewpol
3-1-S, Drew Chemical Company). The selection of an appropriate polyglycerol ester is based mainly on considerations of quality and purity as it effects flavor and wholesomeness rather than on a consideration of lypo-phil/hydrophil properties. Polyglycerol esters having a wide range of properties from highly lipophilic to highly hydrophilic are operable.
Frozen desserts of the present invention having highly desirable character with respect to texture, stability, etc. have been prepared using decaglycerol decastearate as texturizing ingredient which is a highly lipophilic polyglycerol ester. Entirely comparable re-

suits as to texture and stability have been prepared with triglycerol monostearate which is a relatively hydrophilic polyglycerol ester. Other specific polyglycerol esters that have been employed are hexaglycerol distearate and decaglycerol distearate.
Thus, the polyglycerol ester ingredient of the present composition may be broadly defined as one having from 3 to 10 glycerol units in the polyglycerol chain one or more of the hydroxyl groups of which are esteri-fied. At least one is esterified. Since there are (n + 2) hydroxyl groups in a polyglycerol chain in which is the number of glycerol units, a fully esterified polyglycerol contains (n + 2) fatty acyl groups. The entire spectrum of edible fatty acids having from 3 to 20 carbon atoms may be employed for esterifying groups. The preferred fatty acyl groups are those approved for food use and particularly those containing 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, or 20 carbon atoms. When lower fatty acid groups are present, they are preferably present in amounts corresponding to their presence in natural oils or fats such as butter oil. Both the saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl groups are contemplated, but the saturated are preferred. To sum up, the present frozen desserts contain from 0.5 to 1.5 percent by weight of a polyglycerol fatty ester constituted of from 3 to 10 glycerol units and from 1 to (n + 2) fatty acyl groups.
The preferred concentration of polyglycerol ester for the present frozen desserts is 0.8 percent by weight for a product containing about 30 percent total solids. This amount affords a highly desirable balance between stability, suspending, and texturizing properties and mouth feel. Products containing less than 0.5 percent by weight of polyglycerol ester are lacking in some or all of these characters particularly texture and stability. When amounts of polyglycerol ester exceeding 1.5 percent by weight are employed, a rather oleagenous mouth feel is imparted which is undesirable for imitation ice cream or ice milk. Generally those products containing lesser amounts of total solids of about 20-25 percent require larger amounts of polyglycerol ester, e.g. 1-1.5 percent. Conversely for higher amounts of solids of about 35-40 percent, a lesser amount of polyglycerol ester of about 0.5 percent is preferred.
The polyglycerol ester texturizing ingredient is believed to perform multiple functions including the following.
1.	It assists in maintaining a uniform suspension of water insoluble ingredients in liquid mixes which may be aerated and frozen as in ice cream manufacture.
2.	It prevents water separation when the frozen dessert melts. A homogenous liquid melt is characteristic of ice creams and ice milks, and accordingly such is desired for the frozen desserts of the present invention.
3.	It reduces ice crystallization on storage of the frozen dessert. This problem is particularly aggravated with low fat products.
4.	It confers a mouth feel on the frozen dessert similar to that of ice cream, and in this respect is believed to serve as a fat substitute on the basis of about one part by weight polyglycerol ester per 10 to 20 parts by weight of fat.
Another ingredient, which contributes significantly to the quality of the product is a hydrophilic colloid or gum as stabilizer. Such ingredient is especially desirable for the hard ice creams which may be stored for
4
considerable periods prior to consumption. For shakes or soft ice creams which are usually consumed immediately after freezing such ingredient is not needed, although, small amounts are useful for maintaining a uniform liquid mix prior to freezing.
The hydrophilic colloid ingredient is used in an amount ranging from 0 percent up to 0.5 percent by weight of the finished product. For imitation hard ice creams the stabilizer seems to serve the function of delaying or preventing undesired crystallization of ice or sugars, etc. For these products the amount of stabilizer is preferably from about 0.2 to 0.5 percent by weight. Higher amounts are not recommended because of so-called “melt resistance.” For ice cream, a liquid melt is desired and excess stabilizer prevents this with formation of a stiff, pudding-like melt. Amounts less than 0.2 percent are not sufficiently effective for prolonged storage of hard frozen products. For soft ice creams and shakes which are consumed immediately after freezing from 0.05 percent to 0.2 percent of stabilizer is preferred to maintain the liquid mix in smooth suspension prior to freezing, but satisfactory products for immediate consumption after freezing can be prepared containing no hydrophilic colloid stabilizer.
Suitable hydrophilic colloids include the vegetable gums such as acacia gum, xanthan gum, or other well known gums such as locust bean gum and carrageenan. Other hydrophilic colloids that are suitable are water soluble proteins such as gelatin, and water dispersible polysaccharides such as dextran, pectin, carboxymeth-ylcellulose, starch (preferably pregelatinized), etc. The simple disaccharides or trisaccharides such as sucrose which form true solutions are not considered hydrophilic colloids for present purposes. A more complete list of suitable hydrophilic colloids is published in “Handbook of Food Additives,” Chemical Rubber Publishing Company, Cleveland, Ohio, 1968, page 315.
Milk solids are, of course, a required ingredient according to various state regulations for a product to be labeled ice cream or ice milk. This ingredient and other food solids present in the product serve as bodying ingredients and contribute to the texture and mouth feel of the finished product. From 20 to 40 percent by weight of the finished product is made up of edible solids including the milk solids (6 to 20 percent) and fat (0 to 7 percent). Other bodying ingredients which may be included in the 20 to 40 percent total edible solids of the present compositions include sugar which, of course, can also serve as sweetener. It is possible to omit sugar entirely and use artificial sweeteners or to employ a reduced amount where a further reduction in calories is desired. An inert bodying material such as dextran, inulin, or microcrystalline cellulose may be substituted for sugar when artifical sweeteners are employed. For a chocolate frozen dessert, cocoa may be employed both as a flavoring agent and as bodying ingredient. Other suitable bodying ingredients include fructose, dried egg white, and starch. Bulky characterizing ingredients such as cut or chopped fruit or nuts may be employed. Non-nutritive bodying ingredients are not employed when the total food solids content reaches 40 percent by weight.
In some embodiments of the present invention, the milk solids are replaced by an equivalent amount on a weight basis of another protein ingredient such as sodium caseinate, potassium caseinate, calcium casein-

ate, vegetable proteins such as soybean protein isolate, soybean protein concentrate, fish flour, and vegetable flours such as peanut flour, sunflower seed flour, or soybean flour. When using protein substitutes of this sort which contain a higher percentage of protein than dry skim milk, and reduced bulk, it is usually desirable to supplement them with an additional bodying ingredient of the type referred to above. Ordinarily carbohydrates are selected for this purpose such as starch, sugar, or lactose but non-nutritive materials may also be used.
Up to 7 percent by weight of fat, preferably milk fat due to its high palatability, may be employed in the products of the present invention when preparing an ice milk. Ice milks contain 2 to 7 percent by weight of fat, at least 11 percent milk solids and at least 28 percent total solids. The most preferred embodiments of the present invention, however, are essentially fat free. By this is meant that no triglyceride fat ingredient as such is employed. Small amounts of fat may, however, be inherently included because of its presence in certain of the other ingredients. For example, when cocoa is used as a flavoring and bodying ingredient, a small amount of fat is inherently present because it is contained in the cocoa. The same applies to some of the protein ingredients referred to above as substitutes for milk solids. Soybean flour for instance may contain up to 20 percent by weight of fat. In any event, the fat content does not exceed 7 percent by weight of the finished product. The preferred low calorie imitation ice creams of the present invention contain less than 2 percent fat and the most preferred contain no triglyceride ingredient at all.
Liquid mixes which may be frozen with aeration to provide the present frozen desserts are also considered part of this present invention. They have precisely the same composition on a weight basis as the finished product. The criterion of the final products which is not applicable to the liquid mixes is that of specific gravity. They generally have a specific gravity of the order of
1.05	to 1.2 while the frozen products have specific gravities of 0.45 to 0.73 due to aeration while freezing. Aeration while freezing is preferably accomplished by stirring, but aerosol or other mechanical devices to cause the dispersion of an inert gas such as nitrogen or a fluorinated hydrocarbon may be used.
A convenient means of preparing and distributing the present frozen desserts is to incorporate the principal ingredients into a dry pre-mix which is used by the dairy to prepare the foregoing liquid mix prior to freezing. The dry pre-mix shoujd contain the polyglycerol fatty ester texturizing ingredient, the hydrophilic colloid stabilizer if one is used, and desirably some or all of the flavoring and sweetening ingredients. In its essentials this is what the dry pre-mix is constituted of. For example, a dry mix for preparation of 100 parts by weight of a liquid mix should contain from 0.5 to 1.5 parts by weight of the edible polyglycerol fatty ester texturizing ingredient, from 0.05 to 0.5 parts by weight of a hydrophilic colloid stabilizer as described above, and flavoring and sweetening ingredients. It is preferred, however, to include other food solid ingredients with the foregoing ingredients as a carrier therefore. For this purpose, from 17.5 to 38 parts by weight of food solids or non-nutritive bodying ingredients of the types referred to above may be employed. Dry mixes to
6
which it is only necessary to add water, aerate, and freeze have been prepared.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
For preparation of the dry pre-mix which is constituted with liquid ingredients to provide the liquid mix which is frozen with aeration to yield the frozen dessert of this invention, a granulate polyglycerol ester is desirable since dry blending with other dry ingredients is a convenient first step. Suitable polyglycerol esters processed into granulate form are commercially available. The polyglycerol esters are inherently wax-like solids which are rather inconvenient to handle. Spray-cooling of the molten polyglycerol ester either in the pure state or with preservatives or carriers is one method used to provide granulate forms. The wax-like form of polyglycerol ester may be used to prepare the present frozen desserts if first melted with water or other aqueous ingredient. Hydration of the ester appears to take place under this treatment in the temperature range of 125°-135° F. which facilitates incorporation thereof into the liquid mix. This is illustrated by Examples 1 and 2.
EXAMPLE 1. IMITATION ICE CREAM
Triglycerol monostearate (Durkreme 310), 8 grams is mixed with 8 grams of water and kept at 125°-135° F. overnight. This and the following ingredients are then mixed with sufficient water to provide a kilogram of mix.
