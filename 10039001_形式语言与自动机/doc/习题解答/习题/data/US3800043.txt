GASTROINTESTINAL SPASMOLYTIC AGENTS
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This is a continuation-in-part application based on copending U.S. Ser. No. 89,005, filed Nov. 12, 1970, now abandoned.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
This invention describes new 1-substituted phenyl bi-guanide compounds and processes for their preparation. This invention further provides valuable pharmaceutical preparations which contain 1-substituted phenyl biguanide compounds as active gastric an-tisecretory and spasmolytic agents. A method for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and diseases is also described. The compounds of this invention also possess an effective degree of antihypertensive and CNS depressant activity.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The pharmaceutical compositions which have been used as gastric antisecretory and spasmolytic agents have been such as atropine, homatropine, propantheline bromide, dicyclomine hydrochloride and other compounds which are structurally dissimilar to the biguanides of this invention. Due to the anticholinergic properties of these compounds they are known to produce undesirable side effects such as mydriasis, xerostomia, cyclopegia and other unwanted effects.
There have been a number of 1 -aryl biguanides described in the literature. They have been proposed for use as antidiabetics, anorexigenic or antimalarial agents. J. H. Burn and J. R. Vane, however, in the Brit J. Pharmacol. (1948),	3:346-9 tested l-(p-
clorophenyl)biguanide for its ability to reduce gastric secretion. Their findings determined that little or no reduction of gastric secretion was associated with this compound. Contrary to this belief:
We have unexpectedly found that when an alkyl group is present in a halophenyl biguanide compound valuable pharmacologic properties exist and these compounds then unexpectedly possess useful gastric antisecretory and spasmolytic properties.
We have also found that the compounds of this invention are substantially free of the anticholinergic side-effects which accompany gastric antisecretory and spasmolytic agents.
We have further found that the compounds of this invention have a low order of toxicity.
We have still further found a simple and effective method for treating gastrointestinal disorders and diseases, such as duodenal and peptic ulcers.
We have found that the 1-substituted phenyl biguanides of this invention also have an effective degree of antihypertensive and CNS depressant activity.
DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENT
This invention describes a class of novel chemical compounds which comprise a phenyl ring which is substituted with at least one alkyl and one halo group.

Condensation of cyanoguanide and a substituted aniline in the presence of an equimolar amount of a mineral acid results in the corresponding substituted phe-nylbiguanide.

where:
HX is a mineral acid.
The reaction is preferably carried out on the aniline salt either in a polar medium or neat and using increased temperatures. The salt used may be any acid addition amine salt but preferably the salt of a mineral acid. The polar medium may be aqueous, partially aqueous or a non-aqueous solution. It is convenient to choose a solvent that will reflux at the desired reaction temperature. The more preferred solvents are water or alcohol but other solvents may be used such as DMSO, diethyleneglycol, ethyleneglycol, tetrahydrofuran, di-methylformamide, etc. The reaction should also be carried out at a temperature which is high enough so that condensation takes place readily, but not sufficient to decompose the biguanide formed. The reaction temperature can vary from room temperature to about 250°C although it is preferable to run the reaction at temperatures from about 50°C to 150°C. The biguanide salt which is formed can be converted to the free base with a metal hydroxide or alkoxide solution. The isolation of the desired biguanide can be carried out by any method known in the art.
A special embodiment of this invention describes a novel process for preparing the instant biguanide'com-pounds. We have unexpectedly found that when the reaction of the substituted aniline with cyanoguanidine takes place in a mildly acidic solvent which is non-nucleophilic then the condensation takes place in high yield. We have further found that this reaction works on highly hindered as well as highly unreactive anilines. It is preferable to use a phenolic solvent such as a phenol, cresol, xylol, etc. The reaction can be carried out at temperatures from room temperature to about 150°C; however, it is preferable to use temperatures between 60°-100°C. Isolation of the reaction product can be carried out by chemical or physical techniques; however, it is convenient to precipitate the salt of the product out of the reaction mixture with a nonpolar solvent such as ether or by making the reaction mixture alkaline and extracting with ether.
The starting anilines are either known or may be prepared by known alkylation and halogenation techniques. Thus, alkylation may be carried out on an acetanilide using an alkyl halide and aluminum chloride under Friedel-Crafts conditions to obtain desired substitution in the ortho and para positions. Chlorination or bromination of an acetanilide or aniline may be carried out in acetic acid, or in the presence of a small amount of iodine dissolved in an inert solvent such as carbon tetrachloride. A solution of chlorine or bromine is then added while the temperature is held near 0°C. This halogenates in the ortho and/or para positions. Alkylation or halogenation followed by halogenation or alkylation results in the desired alkyl-halo anilide. Further alkylation or halogenation results in the desired polysubstituted anilides. Deacylation with 50% sulfuric acid or alcoholic potassium hydroxide results in the aniline.
Iodination can also be carried out by methods known in the art using iodine monochloride (C1I).

An acetanilide may be alkylated and/or halogenated as above to obtain the ortho and/or para halo and/or 25 alkyl acetanilide. A Friedel-Crafts reaction of the latter with acetyl chloride results in the introduction of the acetyl group into the para position to the acetanilide.
The acetamido group may then be deacylated followed by deamination through a diazonium to obtain desired meta alkyl and/or halo substitution. The acetophenone

Nitration of the above anilides followed by reduction to the amine which is then diazotized to the diazonium
The compounds of this invention have a useful degree of gastric anti-secretory activity and are effective in reducing the volume and the acidity of the gastric
3,800,043
20
fluid in humans and mammals. Further, these compounds produce a considerable spasmolytic action on the gastrointestinal musculature, i.e., they reduce the peristaltic action of the gastrointestinal musculature which is manifested by a delay in gastric emptying time. 5 It should further be noted that these compounds are also characterized by their low acute oral toxicity.
In particular the 1-substituted phenylbiguanides as herein described are useful in the treatment of such gastrointestinal disorders and diseases as duodenal 10 ulcer and peptic ulcer.
The instant compounds may be used alone or in combination with other known antacids such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, aluminum glycinate, calcium carbonate and the 15 like.
The compounds of this invention possess blood-pressure lowering activities and are also useful as antihypertensive agents.
For all these purposes, the biguanides of this invention can be normally administered orally or parenter-ally. Orally they may be administered as tablets, aqueous or oily suspension, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. 25
Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavor- 30 ing agents, coloring agents, preserving agents and the like, in order to provide a pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparation.
The dosage regimen in carrying out the methods of this invention is that which insures maximum therapeu- 35 tic response until improvement is obtained and thereafter the minimum effective level which gives relief. Thus, in general, the dosages are those that are therapeutically effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal disease conditions or symptoms, such as duodenal and 40 peptic ulcer, and in the alleviation of hypertensive disorders. In general, the daily dose can be between about
0.5 mg/kg and 70 mg/kg (preferably in the range of
2-25 mg/kg/day), bearing in mind, of course, that in selecting the appropriate dosage in any specific case, 45 consideration must be given to the patient’s weight, general health, age, and other factors which may influence response to the drug.
Various tests in animals have been carried out to show the ability of the compounds of this invention to 50 exhibit reactions that can be correlated with activity in humans. These tests involve such factors as the effect of the 1 -substituted phenylbiguanides on gastric secretion, their spasmolytic effect, their mydriatic effect and determination of their toxicity. It has been found that the compounds of this invention when tested in the above variety of situations show a marked activity.
One such test is the gastric secretion test. This test is carried out as follows: Shay rats are fasted for 4-8 hours, and water is given ad lib. The rats are selected 0 at random and separated into groups of 10. The animals are treated intraduodenally (I.D.) the test compound or the vehicle immediately subsequent to the ligation of the stomach at the pyloric sphincter. The ani- 65 mals are sacrificed with chloroform at 4 hours postdrug administration, the stomach is removed and its contents are assayed for volume, pH and total acids.

A second gastric secretion test is carried out on the dog. This is outlined in the Handbook of Physiology, Section 6: Alimentary Canal, Volume II: Secretion. American Physiology Society, Washington, D.C., 1967.
It has been found that the compounds of this invention when subjected to the above gastric secretion tests display marked ability to decrease gastric volume and gastric acidity. These tests are known to correlate well with gastric activity in humans and are standard tests used to determine anti-secretory properties.
To determine the anti-ulcer effectiveness the following test is employed: Male Wistar rats (130-150 grams) are fasted for 24 hours, then given reserpine at 5 mg/kg i.p. Twenty-four hours later, the stomachs are removed and examined for ulceration. Ulcers are graded on a 0-4 scale and the number of ulcers is recorded. Pretreatment with the biguanide compounds produces a decrease in ulcer grade and the number of ulcers compared to the control reserpine-treated rats.
Determination of anti-spasmolytic properties can be carried out by the procedure as outlined by D. A. Bro-die and S. K. Kundrats in their article entitled “Effect of Drugs on Gastric Emptying in Rats”, Fed. Proc. 24:714 (1965).
Mydriasis is detected by the procedure of R. A. Turner, Screening Methods in Pharmacology, Academic Press, New York, and London, pp. 174-5, 1965. Acute toxicity is calculated according to the standard Litchfield-Wilcoxon procedure.
In view of the results of these tests, the pharmacological data clearly indicates that the 1-substituted phenylbiguanides of this invention can be considered to be active gastric anti-secretory and anti-spasmolytic agents which are substantially free of anti-cholinergic side effects and having a low toxicity.
Tests in animals have also been carried out to show the ability of compounds of this invention to inhibit reactions that can be correlated with hypertensive effects in humans. One such test is outlined by Jacques de Champlain, Lawrence R. Krahoff and Julius Axelrod in Circulation Research XXIII:479 (1968). This testing method is known to correlate well with hypertensive activity in humans and is a standard test used to determine anti-hypertensive properties. In view of the results of this test, the 1-substituted phenylbiguanides of this invention can be considered to be active anti-hypertensive agents.
To determine the CNS depressant effectiveness of the compounds of Formula I, the suppression of spontaneous motor activity is evaluated in normal mice (18-22 g) and immature rats (90-100 g) by a modification of the Dew method: Dews, Brit. J. Pharmacol: 8, 46 (1953). Results of this test indicate that a relative increase in depressant activity is evident.
The following are detailed examples which show the preparation of the compounds of this invention. They are to be construed as illustrations of said compounds and not as limitations thereof.
