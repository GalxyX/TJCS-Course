HAIR CONTROL COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD OF USE
This invention relates to hair preparations, and more particularly to hair control preparations for holding the hair in a desired configuration. Preparations of this kind include hair setting lotions and hairsprays, the most popular form of such product being the aerosol hairspray or hairdressing.
These preparations act by forming a deposit of a filmforming resin on the hair which acts to hold the hair in place and maintain it in the desired configuration.
Users of products of this type, particularly users of hairsprays, who use the products frequently find that the resin deposited on the hair tends to build up despite brushing of the hair between applications and that as a consequence the hair becomes progressively more difficult to comb and brush out. Furthermore, this accumulation of resin gives the hair an unnatural feel. One can, of course, mitigate this disadvantage by applying less resin to the hair but this, however, results in less hold being obtained.
In the work leading up to the present invention we found that the resins which have the better hair retaining properties are those which are relatively flexible whereas those which are the more easily combed or brushed out of the hair are the more brittle resins. In other words, those resins having the lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) have the better hold characteristics and those of higher glass transition temperatures have the better comb-out properties.
We have now discovered that improved hair control preparations can be formulated by including along with resin a resin-modifying agent which is normally solid (i.e., is solid at 20° C) and which softens the resin and improves its initial holding properties but which over a relatively short period of time, say Within 15 hours, volatilises from the hair whereby the resin is gradually converted into a form in which it is more easily combed out of the hair.
Accordingly the invention provides a hair control preparation comprising a solution of a film-forming resin and a normally solid material which plasticises the resin and which gradually volatilises from the resin after applying the preparation to the hair, the weight ratio of resin to volatile plasticiser being from 1:2 to 20:1. .
An advantage of the invention is that by the use of the volatile plasticiser one can improve the initial holding properties of the resin (matching that obtainable with a comparable or even greater amount of a softer resin) and produce a resin deposit which develops over a period of time an improved ease of removal as the plasticiser volatilises from the hair. From another aspect, the use of a volatile plasticiser in accordance with the invention permits one to improve the initial hold properties of a hair preparation without increasing the amount of the resin in the preparation: an increase in the amount of the resin would result in more resin being applied to the hair with the consequence that the hair would be more difficult to comb out.
The film-forming resins used in preparations in accordance with the invention desirably have glass transition temperatures (Tg) of at least 20° C. The use of the Tg is a common way of characterising resins and is described for example by Burrell, H in “Official Digest,” 34, 131 (1962). It can be determined by the technique
2
known as Differential Thermal Analysis (see, for example, the method of Keavney, JJ and Eberlin, EC in J.Appl.Polymer Sci., 3 47 (1960). A high Tg is an indication of the brittleness of a resin. In accordance with our finding that the more brittle the resin the more easily it is combed out of the hair, the preferred resins used in hair compositions of this invention are those having a Tg of at least 35° C and usually no more than 150° C.
The volatile plasticisers used in preparations in accordance with the invention desirably have a vapour pressure at a temperature of 25° and at a pressure of 760 mm Hg of from 0.00001 mm to 2 mm Hg. The preferred plasticisers have a vapour pressure of from 0.0001 mm to 0.1 mm Hg.
Suitable combinations of resin and volatile plasticiser that illustrate the invention are listed below together with relevant glass transition temperature and vapour
pressure data.

It is to be understood that the invention is not limited solely to the resin/volatile plasticiser combinations specifically referred to above. Some experimentation may be necessary in order to select other suitable combinations of resin and normally solid volatile plasticiser for use in the present invention. A plasticiser for one resin is not necessarily suitable for plasticising another resin. For instance, benzophenone, when used with resins obtained by copolymerising vinyl pyrrolidone with no more than an equal amount of vinyl acetate (and with certain other water-soluble resins) is reported in British Patent Specification No. 868,879 to result in a stiffening of the resin (i.e., the opposite of a plasticising effect).
The film-forming resin and the volatile plasticiser are both present in the hair preparation as a solution in a mutually suitable solvent. As an example, the solvent can be a volatile organic solvent such as an alcohol, especially ethanol, isopropanol or 2-methoxyethanol: methylene chloride is also a suitable volatile organic solvent.
The weight ratio of film-forming resin to volatile plasticiser in the hair preparation according to the invention is from 1:2 to 20:1. By appropriate choice of the ratio of resin to plasticiser and of the content of resin in the solution, it is possible to obtain hair preparations which differ widely in their properties.
At low resin:plasticiser ratios, the difference between the degree of hold exerted by the hair preparation initially and that exerted when the majority of the plasticiser has volatilised is quite marked, whereas at high resimplasticiser ratios the difference between the initial hold and the hold at a later time is less marked.
The preferred weight ratio of film-forming resin to volatile plasticiser is from 1:1 to 10:1.
The amount of resin present in the solution will depend on the degree of hold the product is intended to produce and will usually be from 1 to 10 percent by weight of the solution.
The hair preparation is preferably in the form of an aerosol hairspray. In this case the solvent, especially one of those previously exemplified, the film-forming resin and the volatile plasticiser will be present in an aerosol dispenser together with a suitable aerosol propellant, usually a liquefied normally gaseous substance. Commonly used propellants are trichloroflu-oromethane (propellant 11) and dichlorodifluoro-methane (propellant 12) but others may be employed. Suitable propellants and propellant mixtures
4
for use with hairsprays are well known to those in the art.
Aerosol hairspray preparations in accordance with the invention will comprise concentrate and propellant in the usual ratios, generally from about 2:1 to 1:5 with the concentrate having typically the following composition:
% by weight
Resin	2 to 10
Volatile plasticiser	0.05 to	10
Perfume	0.3 to 1
Solvent	balance	to 100
In aerosol hairsprays, the amount by weight of resin based on the total weight of hairspray is usually from
0.5 to 4.0 percent.
In further embodiments of the hair control preparation of the invention other than those based on an aerosol formulation, the preparation may simply be in the form of a solution of the resin and plasticiser in the solvent, for example in the weight proportions as set out for the above concentrate. In other product forms, particularly for hair setting lotions, an aqueous alcoholic solvent can be used. In certain other cases it might also be possible to use water as the solvent, although the presence of a volatile organic solvent is preferred to give a quick drying product. Other conventional ingredients can be incorporated, if desired, for example a denaturant for ethanol.
. In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a process is provided for treating human hair to impart hold to a desired style and subsequently to facilitate the brush out property of the hair as the hold diminishes by applying to the hair a hair control preparation of the type defined herein.
Examples of hair control preparations in accordance with the invention will now be described. Percentages are by weight.

drawn through a comb five times and an average combining resistance value determined for the switches. In this experiment, the comb used was one which had a.. strain gauge transducer cemented onto the back of it and the varying resistance produced by varying strains on the gauge as the hair travelled through the comb was processed electronically. During the determination of the combing resistance value, the hair switches were in a cabinet maintained at a temperature of 23° C and a relative humidity of 35 percent.
The combing resistance values given below have been corrected to allow for any variation in resistance to combing of the untreated switches, so that the values given are a measure, in empirical units, of the increase in work required to comb the hair due to the applied hairspray.
The above test procedure was carried out on a number of compositions containing different plasticisers and the results are given in Table I.
We have found that the hold of the hair as judged by users correlates well with the combing resistance.
