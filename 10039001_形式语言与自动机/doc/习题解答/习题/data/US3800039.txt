ANTITHROMBOGENIC PROCESS EMPLOYING
SUBSTITUTED 6,7-DIALKOXYQUIN AZOLINES
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The subject of the present invention refers to drug and body treating compositions and is concerned with a method of preventing blood platelet aggregation employing a group of substituted quinazolines.
Platelet aggregation is considered to be part of a complex physiological mechanism of formation of thrombi in the vascular system. Thromboembolic phenomena, i.e., the formation of thrombi, is involved in hemostasis and a number of diseased states in mammals including thrombophlebitis, phlebothrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, coronary thrombosis and retinal vessel thrombosis. An increase in the propensity for platelet aggregation, sometimes referred to as platelet adhesiveness, is observed following parturition, in surgical operations, ischaemic heart disease, atherosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, intracranial tumors, thromboembolism, and hyperlipemia; refer to A. Poplawski et al., J. Atherosclerosis Research, 8, 721 (1968).
The substituted quinazolines of Formula I which are employed in the present invention differ both structurally and in their biological action from anticoagulant substances such as heparin and derivatives of coumarin and indandione. For instance, heparin does not inhibit the aggregation of blood platelets at dosages which prevent coagulation of the blood. Coumarin and indandione derivatives interfere with the synthesis of prothrombin in the liver which causes a decrease in thrombin formation thereby preventing the formation of fibrin (which causes blood to clot) from fibrinogen at dosages which have no effect on blood platelet aggregation. More recently the use of dipyridamole as an antithrombogenic agent has been described, refer to R. Eliasson and S. Bygdeman, Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Ind-vest., 24, 145 (1969).
Some of the 2,4-alkyl substituted quinazolines useful in the present invention have been disclosed by J. L. Minielli and H. C. Scarborough in U.S. Pat. No. 3,248,292 to be useful as bronchodilator, vasodilator, cardiac stimulant, and anit-inflammatory agents. However, it was not recognized until our discovery that the substances disclosed by Minielli et al. as well as other selected quinazolines effectively inhibit aggregation of blood platelets.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
This invention is concerned with the use of compounds of the quinazoline class as inhibitors of blood platelet aggregation. In particular, the invention relates to tbe use of a group of substituted quinazolines characterized by Formula I and the non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in the prevention of mammalian blood platelet aggregation. Prevention of blood platelet aggregation by the quinazolines is. an activity also referred to herein an antithrombogenic activity. The quinazolines of Formula I are particularly useful in preventing blood platelet aggregation and are suitable for use in the treatment of mammals subject to thromboembolic diseases such as thrombophlebitis, phlebothrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, coronary thrombosis and retinal vessel thrombosis.
Formula I
It has been discovered that the substances which are characterized by Formula I effectively inhibit blood platelet aggregation in mammalian blood.
In Formula I, R2 may be hydrogen or lower alkyl having from one to five carbon atoms inclusive. The substituent R4 can be hydrogen, lower alkyl of from one to five carbon atoms inclusive, primary amino, and lower alkylamino from one to four carbon atoms inclusive. R4 also may be lower alkoxy from one to four carbon atoms inclusive or cyano. Also R4 is comprised of phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl, or halogen monosubstituted phenyl, benzyl, phenethyl wherein the halogen is chlorine, bromine, fluorine or iodine. R6 and R7 may be lower alkyl from one to five carbon atoms inclusive and also may be taken together in the form of R60 and R70 to form the methylenedioxy group. As used in this disclosure, the term “lower alkyl” and “lower alkoxy” comprehends both straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radicals such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, 1-butyl, 1-methylpropyl, 2-methylpropyl, tert.-butyl. In -dimethylpropyl, to these saturated hydrocarbon radicals, lower alkoxy and lower alkyl groups of five carbon atoms can include n-pentyl, 3-methylbutyl (isopentyl), 2,2-diriiethylpropyl, 1-methylbutyl, 2-methylbutyl, 3-pentyl and the like.
A particularly preferred group of compounds useful as antithrombogenic agents comprises those of Formula I wherein R6 and R7 are limited to methyl or ethyl radicals while R2 and R4 are as defined above.
Another group of compounds which are effective antithrombogenic agents are those wherein R6 and R7 are methyl, R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and methyl; and R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, and lower alkyl of from one to five carbon atoms inclusive, cyano, primary amino, me-thylamino, and ethylamino.
A still further preferred group of compounds comprises those substances of Formula I wherein R6 and R7 are methyl, R2 is hydrogen or methyl and R4 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, cyano, primary amino, (lower) alkylamino and (lower) alkoxy.
Exemplary of substances of the present invention which can be employed as effective antithrombogenic agents are 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethylquinazoline, 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline,	6,7-dimethoxy-4-
methylquinazoline,	6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-2-
methylquinazoline,	4-amino-6,7-
dimethoxyquinazoline,	6,7-dimethoxy-4-
methylaminoquinazoline hydrochloride and 4-benzyl-
6,7	-dimethoxyquinazoline.
Both 6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline and 2-methyl-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline have been described in the literature, refer respectively to C. A. Fetscher, et al., J. Org. Chem. 4, 71 (1939), and A. Rilliet, Helv. Chim. Acta., 5, 547 (1922). According to United States Patent 3,248,292, these compounds are useful as bronchodilator, vasodilator, cardiac stimulant and antiinflammatory agents.

which are useful in the present invention. These 6,7-dialkoxy-quinazolines are obtained according to the reaction sequence outlined below. This method is applicable to those substituted quinazolines of Formula II wherein R2, R6 and R7 are as defined above and “A” comprehends hydrogen, alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, phen-ethyl, halogen and monosubstituted phenyl, benzyl, and phene thy 1.

Formula II
Stage 1 involves acylation of veratrole, dialkoxy catechol ethers, or methylenedioxybenzene under Friedel and Crafts acylation conditions with an alkanoyl chloride having from one to six carbon atoms. The hydrocarbon residue of the alkanoyl chloride apart from the carbonyl function corresponds to the desired “A” substituent in Formula II. Acylation may also be carried out with benzoyl chloride or an aralkanoyl chloride.
Nitration of the resulting dialkoxyphenone in Stage 2 is carried out with nitric acid or a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids, or other suitable aromatic nitration agents. The resulting 6-nitro-3,4-dialkoxyphenone is then selectively reduced in Stage 3 to the corresponding aminophenone. This reduction is carried out by catalytic or by chemical means. Acylation of the amino group in Stage 4 is conducted in conventional fashion well-known to those skilled in the art. For example, treating the intermediate from Stage 3 with formic acid or a mixture of formic acid and acetic anhydride introduces the N-formyl group when the R2 substituent is hydrogen. When R2 is alkyl, the appropriate acyl halide or anhydride can be used. At Stage 5, ring closure is carried out when R2 is hydrogen by heating the 3,4-dialkoxy-6-formamidophenone with ammonia in molten ammonium formate.
If an alkyl substituent having from one to five carbon atoms inclusive is desired for R2, the 6-aminophenone from Stage 3 is acrylated in Stage 4 with the anhydride or acid halide of an alkanoic acid having two to six carbon atoms. At Stage 5, ring closure is conducted by
heating the acylaminophenones from Stage 4 with ammonia in molten ammonium acetate or molten ammonium salt of the acid corresponding to the acylating agent employed in Stage 4.
5 When ReO and R70 together constitute the methyl-enedioxy group, 6-aminopiperonal or a 3,4-methylene-dioxy-6-aminophenone is treated as indicated in Stages 4 and 5.
The compounds of Formula I wherein the R4 10 substituent is primary amino or (lower) alkylamino or (lower) alkoxy or cyano are prepared by reaction of the appropriately substituted 4-chloro-6,7-dialkoxyquinazolines with ammonia, alkylamino, an alkali metal alkoxide or sodium cyanide in an inert sol-15 vent such as methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, dioxane, phenol, tetrahydrofuran, acetone and the like.
4-Chloro-6,7-dialkoxyquinazolines are obtained from
3,4-dialkoxybenzoic acid esters as follows. The esters are nitrated to form 3,4-dialkoxy-6-nitrobenzoates and 20 the nitro reduced providing 3,4-dialkoxy-6-aminobenzoates. The 3,4-dialkoxy-6-aminobenzoic acid esters are cyclized by treating with molten form-amide to provide 6,7-dialkoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinones. Chlorination of 6,7-dialkoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinones 25 with phosphorus oxychloride provides the 4-chloro-
6,7-dialkoxyquinazolines such as
4-chloro-6,7 -dimethoxyquinazoline, 4-chloro-6,7-diethoxyquinazoline, 4-chloro-6,7-dipropyloxyquinazoline,
30 4-chloro-6,7-diisopropyloxyquinazoIine, 4-chloro-6,7-dibutoxyquinazoline, 4-chloro-6,7-dipentoxyquinazoline.
Similarly, reaction of 2-alkyl-6,7-dialkoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinones with phosphorus oxychloride provides 35 2-alkyl-4-chloro-6,7-dialkoxyquinazolines such as 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-n-propylquinazoline, 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-ethylquinazoline, 4-chloro-6,7-dimethoxy-2-methylquinazoline, 4-chloro-6,7-diethoxyquinazoline,

An R2 substituted-6,7-dialkoxyquinazoline of Formula I wherein R2 is as defined above and R4 is hydrogen can be prepared by reductive dehalogenation of the	corresponding	2-R2-4-chloro-6,7-
dialkoxyquinazoline to the corresponding R2-substituted -6,7-dialkoxy-3,4-dihydroquinazoline which in turn is oxidized to the desired R2-substituted-
6,7-dialkoxyquinazoline with potassium ferricyanide. Alternatively, the reductive dehalogenation may be stopped before the 3,4-dihydroquinazoline is formed thereby eliminating the oxidizing step.
As used herein, the term “non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid solution salts” refers to salts of quinazolines of Formula I with relatively non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Illustrative of non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of 6,7-dialkoxyquinazolines of Formula I are the salts of the variety of inorganic or organic acids such as sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfamic, acetic, lactic, malic, succinic, maleic, fu-maric, tartaric, citric, gluconic, glutaric, ascorbic, benzoic, cinnamic and related acids.
Preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the quinazolines of Formula I is accomplished by admixture of the quinazoline bases with at least one chemical equivalent of any of the various acids hereinabove defined. Generally, the salts are prepared in an inert solvent such as water, ether, benzene, ethanol, ethyl acetate and the like.
The antithrombogenic activity of the quinazolines of Formula I with which this invention is concerned is evaluated according to a method described by Born, Nature, 194, 927 (1962) and O’Brien, J. Clin. Path., 15, 446 (1962). The method is essentially a nephelometric one in which the change of turbidity of a specimen of platelet rich blood plasma (human) is measured on causation of platelet aggregation by addition of a thrombogenic inducing agent such as adenosine-5 diphosphate. In this test, dipyridamole has an ED50 of 210 microgram per 0.5 ml. of platelet rich plasma while the ED50 of the anticoagulant heparin is greater than 1,000 microgram per 0.5 ml. of platelet rich plasma.
The process of the present invention for preventing aggregation of blood platelets in mammalian blood is carried out by contacting the substances of Formula I at a dosage ranging from about 0.5 to 80 micrograms of the quinazoline of Formula I per 0.5 milliliter of mammalian blood. In the intact mammal, this is accomplished by intravenous injection of the substances of Formula I or by other forms of parenteral administration. The antithrombogenic process may also be carried out by oral administration of the quinazolines of Formula I to the mammalian host where they are then rapidly absorbed in the blood stream to provide an effective antithrombogenic concentration therein. The antithrombogenic process of the present invention can be used prophylactically in the treatment of thrombosis in thromboembolic disease.
Formula I quinazolines may be administered for antithrombogenic purposes formulated as tablets, capsules,
elixirs, solutions, suspensions, etc. Unit doses range from about 5 to 500 mg.
The following examples are given in order to illustrate the invention and are not to be construed as limiting it to such examples.
EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS EXAMPLES 1-48
The effectiveness of the quinazolines of Formula I in the process of the present invention for preventing aggregation of blood platelets can be demonstrated in a modification of the Born (supra) and O’Brien (supra) method which is more fully described below.
Platelet rich plasma prepared from human blood is added to a 0.312 inch diameter cell containing a teflon coated stirring bar. This cell is placed into a block heated to 37°C. of a Chrono-log aggregometer containing a magnetic stirrer. The platelet rich plasma is stirred during the entire procedure and the turbidimet-ric changes occurring during the test are recorded with a Lineal-Log Lineal-Log recorder. After a 2 minute preincubation period, the quinazoline which is to be evaluated is added. After several more minutes, adenosine-5'-diphosphate, collagen or epinephrine are added and the response noted. The recording obtained from aggregation of platelets which results in an increase in transmittance, is due to the clumping of platelets thus permitting passage of more light through the suspension. Efficacy of the compound as an antithrombogenic agent is determined by its ability to prevent this increase in transmittance which is completely dependent upon platelet aggregation. Various doses of the substance which is being tested are administered and an effective dose (ED50) preventing a 50 percent increase in transmittance is determined.
According to this test, selected quinazolines which are representative of the quinazolines of Formula I have the following antithrombogenic activity. The ED50 values indicate the concentration in microgram of the test agent per 0.5 ml. of platelet rich plasma which will cause a 50 percent reduction in platelet aggregation induced by 1 microgram of adenosine-5'-diphosphate.

5	Procedure 1 (6).
6,7-Dimethoxy-4-methylquinazoline.—
Ammonium formate, 250 g. and 15.1 g. (0.068 mole) of 3,4-dimethoxy-6-formamidoacetophenone is placed in a 500 ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask 10 equipped with a power stirrer and sintered glass gas addition tube. The flask is heated in an oil bath which is maintained at a temperature of 165°-170°C. After the reactants have melted, the stirrer is started and a rapid stream of ammonia is passed through the reaction mix-15 ture by means of the gas addition tube. After 4 hrs., of treatment in this fashion, the hot solution is quenched in water and then made basic by treatment with ammonium hydroxide and extracted with six 100 ml. portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are 20 dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the dried solvent removed by evaporation. The residue is recrystallized from acetonitrile and then twice recrystallized from ethyl acetate yielding 5.3 g. of analytically pure product (38 percent yield), m.p. 150°-152°C.

Intermediates for Procedure 1.
A.	3,4-Dimethoxy-6-nitroacetophenone.— A mixture of 350 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 150 ml. of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is cooled to—5°C. and 100 30 g. (0.56 mole) of powdered 3,4-dimethoxyacetophenone which is prepared according to J. C. E. Simpson, J. Chem. Soc. 94, (1946), is added thereto in small portions with stirring and cooling to maintain the temperature at about — 5°C. The solution 35 is then stirred for 30 min. and poured into 1 liter of cold water. The product precipitates as a solid which is collected by filtration, washed with water, and recrystallized without drying from ethanol; yield 107 g. (85 percent), m.p. 133°-135°C..
40 B. 3,4-Dimethoxy-6-aminoacetophenone.— The nitro compound of Procedure 1 (A), 22.5 g. (0.1 mole), 200 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, and 0.1 g. of platinum oxide is agitated in an atmosphere of hydrogen at an initial pressure of 60 p.s.i.g. until three molecular 45 proportions of hydrogen have been absorbed. Approximately 4 hr. is required. The catalyst is then removed by filtration and the solvent evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue is then recrystallized from diisopropyl ether, yielding the desired product; 46 percent 50 yield, m.p. 99°-102°C.
C.	3,4-Dimethoxy-6-formamidoacetophenone.— A mixture of 40 ml. of formic acid (98-100 percent pure) and 80 ml. of acetic anhydride is prepared by cau-55 tiously mixing the two reagents with cooling. The mixture is then stirred and 0.12 mole of 3,4-dimethoxy-6-aminoacetophenone is added in one portion. The solution is stirred for 10 min. and then diluted with an equal volume of water. This step is carried out with cooling 60 of the reaction vessel with ice water. The suspension of precipitated product is then thoroughly chilled, and the product collected by filtration and recrystallized from ethyl acetate, yield 83 percent, m.p. 165°-167°C.
Procedure 2	(7). 6,7-Dimethoxy-4-isopentyl-2-
65 methylquinazoline.— 3',4'-Dimethoxy-6'-acetamido-4-methyl-pentanophenone, 15.7 g., and 150 g. of ammonium acetate are mixed in a round bottomed flask and heated until liquification takes place. An oil bath

maintained at 160°-165°C. is adequate for this purpose. Ammonia gas is passed into the liquid melt with stirring for a period of 2 hr. while heating as above. The molten mixture is then poured into 1 liter of water and aqeuous mixture treated with sufficient sodium hydroxide to adjust it to an alkaline pH. The precipitated material is then removed by extraction with chloroform and recovered from the extract by evaporation of the solvent. The solid residue so obtained is recrystallized from heptane, yielding light yellow colored needles weighing 7.1 g., m.p. 89.5°-90.5°C.
Intermediates for Procedure 2.
A.	3',4'-Dimethoxy-4-methylpentanophenone.— A solution of 100 g. (0.72 mole) of veratrole in 500 ml. of methylene chloride is chilled in a reaction flask equipped with stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is protected from the air by employing a nitrogen atmosphere in the reaction vessel. Aluminum chloride, 107 g. (0.18 mole) is added to this solution in portions. A solution of 100 g. (0.74 mole) of isocaproyl chloride in 100 ml. of methylene chloride is then added in portions during a period of about 30 min. The mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hr. It is then chilled in an ice bath and the precipitated aluminum salt complex hydrolyzed by the gradual addition of 400 ml. of 15 percent hydrochloric acid. Sufficient water is then added to dissolve the precipitated aluminum salts and the methylene chloride layer separated. It is thoroughly washed, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent distilled. The residual oil is then distilled in vacuo, yielding the desired product as distillate; 129°-133°C./0.025 mm. Hg„ nD25 1.5337.
B.	3',4'-Dimethoxy-6'-nitro-4-methylpentanophenone.— The product of Procedure 2 (A), 96 g. (0.41 mole) is added to 1 1. of cooled 69 percent nitric acid at 10°C. The mixture is then stirred for about 20 min. at room temperature and poured into several liters of water. The product separates from solution and is recovered by extraction with methylene chloride. Removal of the solvent by distillation yields the desired intermediate as a residue which is recrystallized from aqueous ethanol after treatment with decolorizing charcoal, yield 67 g,, m.p. 76°-79°C.
C.	3',4'-Dimethoxy-6'-acetamido-4-methylpentanophenone.— The nitro compound of Procedure 2 (B), 11.5 g. (0.04 mole) is dissolved in 80 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and reduced with hydrogen at an initial pressure of 60 p.s.i.g. employing 0.1 g. of platinum oxide to supply the catalyst. The calculated quantity of hydrogen is absorbed in about 4 hr. The product is recovered by filtration of the catalyst and evaporation of the filtrate. The crude amino compound so obtained as a yellow oil is treated with 8 ml. of acetic anhydride resulting in transformation thereof into a solid mass of crystalline material. The solid is dissolved in ethanol with warming and the ethanolic solution allowed to cool with the formation of a yellow crystalline solid. This material is recrystallized from a mixture of water and methanol yielding the product as white crystalline needles, m.p. 97°-99°C.
