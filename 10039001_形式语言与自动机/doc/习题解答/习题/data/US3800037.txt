INSECTICIDAL AND ACARICIDAL SUBSTITUTED CARBANILIC ACID ESTERS
This invention relates to substituted carbanilic acid propargyl esters which may be used as synergistic agents for insecticidally and/or acaricidally active substances, and to preparations which in addition to insecticidal or acaricidal substances contain such carbanilic acid propargyl esters.
The compounds which are used as synergistic agents according to the present invention have the formula

This compound is new and therefore also forms a subject of the invention.
The compounds of the formula I may be prepared according to methods which are, in themselves, known, for example, by the reaction of an isocyanate of the formula

Suitable alkyl and alkoxy groups are, for example, methyl, ethyl and methoxy groups.	30
Compounds of special importance are those of the formulae

in an inert solvent, for example, benzene, petroleum ether or dimethylformamide, the substituents Rx, R2, R3, R4 and Rs having the same meanings as those specified for formula I.
The compounds defined by the general formula .1 are capable of increasing the activity of insecticidal and/or acaricidal compounds many-fold (synergism). Surprisingly, it has also been found that when using compounds of the formula I, insects or representatives of the order Acarina, which are resistant to carbamates or phosphoric acid esters, can be rendered completely sensitive to these latter compounds. Suitable insecticidally or acaricidally active substances are, for example, the following compounds:

The use of this synergistic mixture is also especially effective in combatting representatives of the order Ac-arina such as for example Eulaelaps, Echinolaelaps, Laelaps, Haemogamasus, Dermanyssus, Ornithonyssus, Allodermanyssus, in particular Allodermanyssus sanguineus, Pneumonyssus, Amblyomma, Aponomma, Boophilus, Dermacentor, Haemophysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Ornithodorus; Oc-tobius, Gheyletidae, for example Cheyletus, Psorer-gates, Demodicidae, Trombiculidae, for example Trombicula, Eutrombicula, Schongastia, Acomatacu-rus, Neoschongastia, Euschongastia, Sarcoptiformes for example Notoedres, Sarcoptes, Knemidokoptes, Psoroptidae, for example Psoroptes, Chorioptes, oto-dectes or Tetranychidae, for example Tetranychus tela-rius; Tetranychus urticae and the like.
The mixtures can either be used by themselves or together with suitable carriers and/or additives.
Suitable carriers and additives can be solid or liquid and correspond to the substances which are customary in formulation technology, for example, natural or regenerated mineral substances, solvents, dispersing agents, wetting agents, adhesives, thickeners, binders or fertilisers.
Such preparations can be employed in the form of solutions, emulsions, suspensions, granules or dusting agents. The methods of application depend on the end uses and must ensure that the active substance can be finely distributed.
The content of active substance in the preparations described above is between 0.1 and 95 percent. At the same time it should be mentioned that in the case of application from aircraft or by means of other suitable application instruments, concentrations of up to 99.5 percent or even a pure active substance may be employed.
To manufacture solutions, it is possible to employ solvents, especially alcohols, for example ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, ketones, such as acetone or cyclohexanone, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as kerosene, and cyclic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, tetrahydronaphthalene and alkylated naphthalenes, and also chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as tetra-chloroethane, ethylene chloride, and finally also mineral and vegetable oils or mixtures of the above mentioned substances.
Aqueous preparations are preferably dispersions. The compounds of formula (I) and the active sub-
10
stance, as such or in one of the above mentioned solvents, are homogenised in water, preferably by means of wetting agents or dispersing agents. Amongst cationic dispersing agents, quaternary ammonium compounds may be mentioned as an example, and amongst anionic dispersing agents, soaps, aliphatic long-chain sulphuric acid monoesters, aliphatic-aromatic sul-phonic acids and long-chain alkoxyacetic acids may for example be mentioned; amongst non-ionic dispersing agents, polyglycol ethers of fatty alcohols or ethylene oxide condensation products with p-tert. alkylphenols may be mentioned. On the other hand, it is also possible to manufacture concentrates consisting of active substance, synergistic agent or dispersing agent and optionally solvents. Such concentrates can be diluted before use, for example with water.
Dusting agents can be manufactured by mixing or conjoint grinding of the active substance and the synergistic agent with a solid carrier. Possible carriers are for example: talc, diatomaceous earth, kaolin, bentonite, calcium carbonate, boric acid or tricalcium phosphate, but also wood flour, cork powder, charcoal and other materials of vegetable origin. The substances can also be absorbed on the carriers by means of a volatile solvent. Pulverulent preparations and pastes can be rendered capable of suspension in water, and usable as spraying agents, by the addition of wetting agents and protective colloids.
In many cases the use of granules for uniformly releasing the active substance-synergistic agent combinations over a longer period of time is of advantage. These granules can be manufactured by dissolving the active substance in an organic solvent, absorbing this solution by a granular mineral, for example attapulgite or Si02, and removing the solvent. They can also be manufactured by mixing the active substances of formula I with polymerisable compounds, after which a polymerisation is carried out which leaves the active substances unaffected, with the granulation being carried out whilst the polymerisation is still proceeding.
The following Examples illustrate the invention.

Dusting Agents
Equal parts of a mixture of active substance and synergistic agent and of precipitated silica are finely ground. Dusting agents, preferably containing 1-6 percent of active substance, can be manufactured therefrom by mixing with kaolin or talc.
Spraying Powder
To manufacture a spraying powder, the following components are for example mixed and finely ground:
50 parts of a mixture of active substance and synergistic agent
20 parts of highly adsorbent silica
25 parts of Bolus alba (Kaolin)
1.5	parts of sodium 1 -benzyl-2-stearyl-benzimidazole-6,3 '-disulphonate and
3.5	parts of a reaction product of p-tert. octylphe-nol and ethylene oxide.
Emulsion Concentrate
The easily soluble mixture of active substance and synergistic agent can also be formulated as an emulsion concentrate in accordance with the following instruction:
20 parts of a mixture of active substance and synergistic agent,
70 parts of xylene and
10 parts of a mixture of a reaction product of an alkyl phenol with ethylene oxide and calcium dodecylbenzenesulphonate are mixed. On dilution with water to the desired concentration, a sprayable emulsion results.
Granules
7.5	g of a mixture of active substance and synergistic agent are dissolved in 100 ml of acetone and the acetone solution thus obtained is added to 92 g of granular attapulgite. The whole is well mixed and the solvent is stripped off in a rotary evaporator. Granules containing 7.5 percent of active substance are obtained.

Test for Synergistic Action
For this test, female house flies aged from 2 to 5 days were used. Before the start of the test, the flies were 50 sorted as to gender under C02 narcosis, and the females were placed in groups of 10. The flies, which were kept motionless with C02, were treated with a dispenser which on pressing the button each time releases 1 microlitre of the solution of the test substance in ace- 55 tone. After the treatment, the flies were placed in groups of 10 in Petri dishes into which a cottonwool pad impregnated with honey water had been introduced for the flies to feed on. After 24 hours the test was evaluated by counting the flies which could no 6Q longer move. The results quoted in the table represent average values of the percentage destruction from four repeat tests.
