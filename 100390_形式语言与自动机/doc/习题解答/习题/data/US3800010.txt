wherein Z and Z[ have the indicated meaning, are used. The aldehyde of the Formula (20) can advantageously also be used as the hydrate. The compounds of the Formulae (9) and (10) are manufactured from chloral or chloral hydrate by reaction with the corresponding phosphonopropionic acid amide.
The compounds, of the Formulae (1) to (10) can be employed in the most diverse fields, for example as flameproofing agents or pesticides. They can however also be used as intermediate products in the manufacture of other valuable compounds, since further reactions can be carried out at the hydroxyl group, or possibly also at the —NH— group, or the halogen atoms can be replaced by other substituents.
If the compounds are used as flameproofing agents, cellulose-containing fibre materials, for example, can be provided with a flameproof finish. Possible fibre materials are, for example, linen, cotton, rayon, viscose staple or fibre mixtures of such materials with others, such as wool, polyamide fibres or polyester fibres.

Appropriately, compounds of the Formula (1) are used as solutions in organic solvents such as dimethyl-formamide or trichloroethylene.
Another possibility for using the compounds of the Formula (1) as flameproofmg agents consists of incor- 5 porating them directly into the spinning composition of, for example, polyacrylonitrile. The phosphonopro-pionic acid amide derivatives can furthermore also be used for flameproofing polyurethanes, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene copolymers or poly- 10 olefines, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, by incorporating them into the composition of these polymers.
The percentages and parts in the examples which follow are units by weight, unless otherwise stated. The 15 relationship of parts by volume to parts by weight is as of ml to g.
EXAMPLE 1
90.5	parts (0.5 mol) of 3-(dimethylphosphono)- 20 propionic acid amide and 82.75 parts (0.5 mol) of chloral hydrate are suspended in 175 parts of benzene, and heated to the boiling point of the benzene, in a stirred flask of 500 parts by volume capacity, equipped ^ with a water separator, reflux condenser and thermometer. Over the course of 3 hours, 10 parts of water, originating from the chloral hydrate, are trapped in the water separator. When the separation of water is complete, the mixture is treated at the reflux temperature 30 for a further 15 hours. After cooling, the crystalline reaction product which has precipitated is filtered off, rinsed with a little ether and dried.
Yield: 146 parts (89 percent of the theory), melting point 133 to 135°C (decomposition).	35
A sample of the crude product is recrystallised from methanol and dried over phosphorus pentoxide.
Melting point 140° to 141°C (decomposition).
Elementary analysis confirms that the product obtained corresponds to the Formula (10).	40
