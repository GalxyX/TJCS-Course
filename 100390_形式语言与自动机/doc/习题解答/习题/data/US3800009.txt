wherein R1 is a lower alkyl group, R2 is a member selected from the group consisting of R‘0, a lower alkyl group, an aralkyl group of seven to eight carbon atoms and an aryl group of six to seven carbon atoms, R3 is a 20 member selected from the group consisting of an acyclic or cyclic alkyl group of one to six carbon atoms and an aryl group of six to seven carbon atoms, and R4 is a member selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl group, an aralkyl group of 25 seven to eight carbon atoms, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, and a halogen atom.
The methods for preparing a,|8-unsaturated aldehydes, so-called formyl-olefination, consisting of adding two carbon atoms to carbonyl functions as illus- 30 trated by the accompanying equation, have widely been utilized as useful synthetic method in
cyano group etc.) with other carbonyl compounds have been known as well as that of the active methylene group adjacent to aldehyde (aldol-condensation). However, these reactions are accompanied by side-reactions undesirable for the objective reaction in many cases, such as self-condensation or polymerization, since the reactions are usually carried out in the presence of a basic catalyst. In order to remove these side-reactions, various methods, for example, Mannich reaction, Darzen condensation, Reformatsky reaction, have been reported. However, the satisfactory process for formyl-olefination has been unknown.
On the contrary, the process for preparing olefins consisting of reacting a carbonyl compound with a phosphonium ylide compound, so-called Wittig reaction, is very useful reaction for introducing the terminal methylene to carbonyl group or further increasing the hydrocarbon chain as well as Grignard reaction. Attempts to apply this reaction to the aldol-condensation type reaction, for example, the reactions by the ylide compounds involving the electron withdrawing group adjacent to the methylene group in the opposite side against the phosphonium group, as indicated by the formulae II - V, have been known. However, the nucleo-philicity of the reagents to the carbonyl compounds decreases due to the electron-delocalization, for

chemical or pharmaceutical industries, particularly in preparations of pharmaceutically useful compounds such as various steroids, vitamin A, vitamin D, carotenoids and other natural products or medicaments or intermediates thereof.
Representative of the methods is indirect one including modifications thereof, consisting of adding an acetylenic anion to a carbonyl compound followed by rearrangement to desired a,/3-unsaturated aldehyde, for example, as illustrated by the following reaction sequence.

[G. Saucy et al„ Helv. Chim. Acta, 42, 1952 (1959)]. However, these methods are disadvantageous in requirement of multi-step reactions or in low yield or in limitation of application.
Alternative most striking methods are so-called aldol-condensation consisting of condensing an active methylene group adjacent to an aldehyde group with another carbonyl group.
In general, the various methods for reacting the compounds involving an active methylene group adjacent to the electron withdrawing group (e.g. nitro group, carbonyl group, sulfonyl group, a carboxylic acid ester,

example, as indicated in the following equation. Ac-40 cordingly, the reactivity of the reagents is remarkably low in comparison
45 CiHs— il—CH=P(C«Hi)i <---> CuSs—i=CH—P(C#H5)3
with the Wittig reagents involving no electron withdrawing group in the adjacent position. For example, the above-described compound V reacts with benzal-dehyde to yield cinnamic aldehyde, while not react with ketones. Furthermore, the compound V does not react with an aldehyde located at the sterically hindered position (e.g. an aldehyde located at the tertiary position) [Trippett and Walker, J. Chem. Soc., 1266 55 (1961)].
Wadsworth and his co-workers developed the reaction method using phosphonate carbanion as a modification of the Wittig reaction [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 83, 1733 (1961)]. This reaction may be characterized by utilizing the phosphonate carbanion more reactive than the Wittig reagent in order to increase the reactivity of the active methylene compounds involving the electron withdrawing group in the adjacent position. 65 For example, the reactivity of the reagents represented by the following formulae VI - IX, involving the electron withdrawing group in the adjacent position, could considerably be increased

Therefore, in spite of these various attempts, the sufficient process for formyl-olefination has not yet been developed.
The present inventors had studied various methods in order to remove these disadvantages and it has been discovered that the enamine-type phosphonate compounds represented by the above-described general formula I have been excellently effective as reactive agents for preparing a,/3-unsaturated aldehyde by condensing aldehydes involving the active methylene group at the a-position with other carbonyl compounds. The reactive agents of the present invention may be applied to all sorts of carbonyl compounds including aldehydes and ketones and effectively show remarkable reactivity even to the hindered carbonyl compounds such as aldehydes located at the tertiary position. Furthermore, the method of the present invention is much more effective than the above-mentioned other methods in stability of the reagents in reaction medium, in easiness of the reaction procedure, in improvement of the yield or in stereospecificity.

Example 27
5a-Formylethylenepregnane-3,20-dione
According to the same procedure as Example 25, 3,-3:20,20-bisethylenedioxy-5a-formylpregnane is subjected to reaction with ethyl-2-cyclohexylaminovinyl phenylphosphinate. Hydrolysis with oxalic acid and subsequent deketallization with 70 percent acetic acid at 60 - 70°C afford 5a-formylethylenepregnane-3,20-dione having mp. 140 - 144°C in about 75 percent yield, which is identical with an authentic specimen prepared in Example 11.
Example 28
2-Cyclohexylidene-3-phenylpropionaldehyde
To a mixture of 364 mg of 52.9 percent sodium hydride and 3.5 ml of tetrahydrofuran, there is added a solution of 3.07 g of ethyl-(l-benzyl-2-cyclohexylaminojvinyl phenylphosphinate in 4.0 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran under ice-cooling and stirring, and the mixture is then stirred for 20 minutes. A solution of 393 mg of cyclohexanone in 4.0 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added and the resulting solution is refluxed for 4 hours. After cooling, the reaction mixture is poured into ice-water, extracted with ether, then treated in the same manner as Example 21, and then further hydrolyzed with oxalic acid. The product is purified by passing through a column of silica gel to afford 411 mg of 2-cyclohexylidene-3-phenylpropionaldehyde (48.1 percent yield), which is converted to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone identical with an authentic specimen prepared in Example 17.
Example 29
3,3-Ethylenedioxy-l l-oxo-5,17(21 )-pregnadien-21-al
To a mixture of 136 mg of 52.9 percent sodium hydride and 1.0 ml of tetrahydrofuran, there is added a solution of 880 mg of ethyl-2-cyclohexylaminovinyl phenylphosphinate in 7 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture is then stirred for 20 minutes

under ice-cooling. A solution of 340 mg of 3,3-ethylenedioxy-5-androstene-l 1,17-dione in 3 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added and the resulting solution is kept at room temperature for 24 hours under stirring. The reaction mixture is poured into ice-water, extracted with ether, washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness to yield 930 mg of residue. To a solution of this residue in 16 ml of benzene, there is added 5.3 g of sodium acetate, 2.31 g of acetic acid and 16 ml of water, and the resulting mixture is kept at room temperature for 21 hours under stirring. The product is extracted with ether, washed with water and evaporated to dryness to yield a residue, which on crystallization, from di-chloromethane-ether affords 263 mg of 3,3-ethylenedioxy-11 -oxo-5,17( 20 )-pregnadien-21 -al (71.0 percent yield) having mp. 208 - 212°C, which is identical with an authentic specimen prepared in Example 18.
