PROCESS FOR PREVENTING THE
POLYMERIZATION OF CONJUGATED DIENES
This invention relates to a process for preventing the polymerization of conjugated dienes and, more particularly, to a process for preventing the polymerization of conjugated dienes in organic solvents at relatively high temperature.
Processes for extractive distillation or absorption by solvent have been known for the separation and refining in high yield of high purity butadiene or isoprene, both industrially valuable materials, respectively from the C4 hydrocarbon fraction of naphtha cracked oil which contains butadiene, butane, butylene and isobutylene as main components or from the C5 hydrocarbon fraction which contains pentane, pentene, isoprene and piperylene as main components.
It is also known that for those processes solvents, such as acetonitrile (ACN), N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl acetamide (DMAC) and furfural, are used.
Usually the conjugated dienes above referred to are known to be readily oxidized at normal temperature by oxygen and the like present in the solutions and tend to produce polymers when allowed to stand for long. In the operation for separation and refining by a conventional extractive distillation or absorption process, solvents containing butadiene or isoprene are inevitably subjected to temperatures above the boiling point of the C4 or C5 hydrocarbon fractions, e.g., over 70° C. As a consequence, the polymerization of butadiene or isoprene in the solvent is accelerated and the polymerization product is deposited. This phenomenon is easily observed because the originally transparent solution is colored with time until it is opaque and a deposition of polymer occurs.
Such a polymer deposit causes various troubles. For example, it forms a thin polymer film over the inner walls of the equipment, clogs the passages, and reduces the extraction efficiency, thus making it practically difficult to operate the equipment continuously for many hours.
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the foregoing difficulties, that is, to prevent the polymerization of the conjugated dienes during the operation above described.
To achieve this object diversified studies have been made, and it has now been found that the polymerization of conjugated dienes can be effectively prevented by adding an organic phosphoric acid ester which may be represented as

pyridine, quinoline, anthracene, a compound having an alkyl group in the nuclear substituent of pyridine, a compound having an alkyl group in the nuclear substituent of quinoline, etc. to a solvent, such as ACN, NMP, DMF or DMAC, for the extraction of a conjugated diene.

Thus, the present invention provides a process for preventing the polymerization of conjugated dienes in solvents at high temperature characterized by the addition of at least one compound selected from the class consisting of organic phosphoric acid esters of the general formula

(wherein R1; R2 and R3 are phenyl or nuclear substituted phenyl groups, the substituents being alkyl groups, phenyl group or halogen atoms, alkyl or halo-genated alkyl groups or allyl group), pyridine, nuclear substituted derivatives of pyridine wherein the substituents are alkyl groups, quinoline, nuclear substituted derivatives of quinoline wherein the substituents are alkyl groups, and anthracene, to a solvent containing a conjugated diene.
Among the organic phosphoric acid esters which may be advantageously used for the invention are such compounds as triphenyl phosphate and nuclear substituted derivatives thereof wherein the substituents are alkyl groups, phenyl groups or halogen atoms, trialkyl phosphates with or without substitution of the hydrogen of the alkyl group by halogen atom, allylbiphenyl phosphate, diallylphenyl phosphate and other phenyl group-and allyl group- containing compounds.
Suitable triphenyl phosphate and nuclear substituted products thereof are triphenyl phosphate, tri(o-cresyl) phosphate, tri(m-cresyl) phosphate, tri(p-cresyl) phosphate, trixylenyl phosphate, tris(4-t-butylphenyl) phosphate, tris(o-biphenylyl) phosphate, etc. wherein the substituents are alkyl groups, phenyl groups or halogen atoms.
Suitable trialkyl phosphates and halogen substituted derivatives thereof are trimethyl phosphate, tnethyl phosphate, tri-n-propyl phosphate, tri-iso-propyl phosphate, tri-n-butyl phosphate, tri-sec-butyl phosphate, tri-n-amyl phosphate, trihexyl phosphate, triheptyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate and other organic phosphoric acid esters wherein the alkyl groups have from 1 to 8 carbon atoms; and tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tri(2-bromoethyl) phosphate, tri(3-chloropropyl) phosphate, tri(3-bromopropyl) phosphate, tri(3-iodopropyl) phosphate, tri(2,3-dichloropropyl) phosphate, tri(2,3-dibromopropyl) phosphate, tri(2,3-diiodopropyl) phosphate, tri(4-chlorobutyl) phosphate, tri(4-bromobutyl) phosphate, tri(4-iodobutyl) phosphate and other organic phosphoric acid esters containing halogen atom-substituted alkyl groups. As the organic phosphoric acid esters which contain phenyl and allyl groups, diallylphenyl phosphate and allylbiphenyl phosphate are desirable.
Examples of the compounds having alkyl groups in the nuclear substituents of pyridine are: picolines, such as 2-methyl-pyridine, 3-methyl-pyridine and 4-methyl-pyridine; lutidines, such as 2,3-dimethyl pyridine, 2,4-dimethyl pyridine, 2-ethyl pyridine and 3-ethyl pyridine; collidines, such as 2-methyl-4-ethyl pyridine, 2-methyl-5-ethyl pyridine, 2-propyl pyridine, 2-isopropyl

pyridine and 2,4,5-trimethyl pyridine; and parvolines, such as 2,3,4,5-tetramethyl pyridine and 2-butyl pyridine. Examples of compounds having alkyl groups substituted in the nuclear of quinoline are alkyl quinolines, such as 2-methyl quinoline, 3-methyl quinoline, 2,3-dimethyl quinoline, 3,4-dimethyl quinoline, 2-ethyl quinoline and 4-ethyl quinoline.
These polymerization inhibitors are capable of either preventing the polymerization of conjugated dienes at high temperature or permitting the chain transfer of polymerization thereby to avoid the production of any solvent-insoluble polymer. The above-mentioned organic phosphoric acid esters have particularly good polymerization-inhibiting effect.
Those polymerization inhibitors prove fairly effective when used singly. However, the effect of preventing the polymerization of conjugated dienes which is achieved by the addition of those compounds according to the present invention is much enhanced when the compounds are used in combination with an extensive variety of substances, e.g., sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite, sodium sulfide, phenolic compounds and aromatic amine compounds, which are usually employed as polymerization inhibitors or antioxidants for unsaturated compounds. This is because the polymerization inhibitors may be classified from the viewpoint of their mechanisms as such, into two types, i.e., radical chain reaction inhibitors and peroxide decomposing agents, and it is considered that the polymer production is based on the two stages of radical initiation and radical growth. Thus, the process of the invention makes it possible to promote the effect of preventing the polymerization of a conjugated diene in a solvent at elevated temperature remarkably by taking advantage of the synergistic action of the two substances which possess different polymerization inhibiting abilities. The combined use of the different inhibitors proves most beneficial for the prevention of polymerization of isoprene, especially.
The known polymerization inhibitors or antioxidants for unsaturated compounds used in combination with the inhibitors of the present invention include:
1.	NaN02, KNOz, Na2S, methylene blue and mercap-tobenzothiazole;
2.	Phenolic compounds, e.g., hydroquinones, such as
2,5-di-tert.-butyl hydroquinone and 2,5-di-tert.-amyl hydroquinone; phenols,	such as o-
phenylphenol, 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-p-phenylphenol, butylated hydroxytoluene and p-methoxyphenol; cresols, such as 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-p-cresol; catechols, such as di-tert.-butyl catechol and p-tert.-butyl catechol; bisphenols, such as 2,2'-methylene-bis(4-methyl-6-tert.-butylphenol) and 4,4'-methylene-bis(2,6-di-tert.-butylphenol; naphthols, such as a-naphthol, /8-naphthoI, 1,1 '-methylene-bis-2-naphthol; and aminophenols, such as p-aminophenol and 2,6-di-tert.-butyl-a-dime-thyleneamine-p-cresol; and
4
3.	Aromatic amine compounds, e.g.,	p,p'-
diaminodiphenylmethane,	N-phenyl-
anaphthylamine, N-phenyl-/3naphthylamine, p-iso-propoxydiphenylamine, 4,4'-dimethoxydiphenyla-5 mine, N,N'-dipheny-p-phenylenediamine, N,N'-diphenylethylene	diamine,	N,N'-di-o-
tolylethylenediamine, N,N'-di-/3-Naphthyl-p-phenylene diamine, octyldiphenylamines (raono-and di-), and 2,4-diaminotoluene.
10 In accordance with the present invention, the effect of preventing the polymerization of butadiene and isoprene is adequately achieved even in the presence of iron rust which is generally believed contributory to cause the polymerization of dienes. This eliminates the 15 use of expensive special steel as material of the equipment and makes possible steady, continuous operation for an extended period of time.
The amounts of the polymerization inhibitors to be added are varied according to the type and water con-20 tent of the solvent and the operating conditions to be employed. Usually, however, the purpose is achieved by adding the first inhibitors, i.e., organic phosphoric acid esters, pyridine, quinoline, anthracene, the nuclear substituted derivatives of pyridine and quinoline, 25 etc., in an amount of 0.01 to 10 percent, preferably 0.05 to 5 percent, by weight on the basis of the solvent, and adding the second inhibitors, i.e., sodium nitrite, phenolic compounds, aromatic amine compounds, etc., in an amount of 0.001 to 5 percent, preferably 0.005 30 to 1 percent, by weight on the basis of the solvent.
The said inhibitors classified into the two groups as above may be added singly or in combination, respectively, to attain the desired effect.
Of course, the amounts of these addition agents are 35 not confined within the limits above specified.
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples.
Example 1
40---------------------------------------------------—
70 parts of dimethyl formamide containing 5 percent by weight of water and 30 parts of butadiene were mixed and, after the addition of the following inhibitors, the mixtures were treated with heat for 70 hours 45 in the presence of iron rust at a temperature of 150° C and at a gauge pressure maintained at 5.0 kg/cm2, and then the conditions of the products were investigated. Compositions free from water were treated under the same conditions. The results are shown in Table 1.

Further experiments were conducted under the same conditions as described above except that the solvent acetonitrile was replaced by N-methyl pyrrolidone or dimethyl acetamide. In either case, the addition of sodium nitrite (100 ppm) alone led to deposition of a polymer in 70 hours. However, there occurred no such polymer deposition and the solution remained clear when sodium nitrite (100 ppm) was added together 65 with tricresyl phosphate (0.5 wt percent).
Example 3
70 parts of acetonitrile which contained 5 percent by
weight of water was mixed with a C4 hydrocarbon fraction of the composition given in Table 3. With different 60 inhibitors, each of the resulting mixtures was treated with heat for 70 hours in the presence of iron rust in a hermetically sealed vessel at a temperature of 120°C and a gauge pressure of 5 kg/cm2.

in whitening of the solution in 70 hours, whereas the singular use of. pyridine, quinoline or anthracene (0.5 wt. percent) kept the solutions clear 70 hours later. The transparency of the solutions was maintained for even longer periods by the combined use of sodium ni- 5 trite (100 ppm) and one of those inhibitors.
The results of Examples 1 to 4 given above demonstrate the effect achieved in accordance with the present invention for the prevention of polymerization of butadiene at elevated temperature.	10
Example 5
70 parts of acetonitrile which contained 5 percent by weight of water and 30 parts of isoprene were mixed with one of the various inhibitors mentioned below, 15 and the resulting mixtures were treated with heat at 120° C, in the presence of iron rust. The conditions of the products were examined, the results being as compiled in Table 6.

The mixture was continuously fed to the tenth stage from the column top, and the column was operated at a reflux ratio of 5.0, a column top temperature of 47° C and a column bottom temperature of 100° C. The isoprene-containing extracting solution was continuously treated at the next stripping column, and the recovered extractive solvent was directly recycled to the extractive distillation column.
The operation was continued for one week, but the extractive solution showed no sign of change and remained clear. When the same operation was repeated but without the addition of triphenyl phosphate and sodium nitrite to the extractive solvent, the solution began to become white and turbid in 10 hours and gave a polymer deposit lightly orange in color in 20 hours.

Similar experiments were conducted under the same conditions as above but using dimethyl formamide or dimethyl acetamide in place of N-methyl pyrrolidone as the solvent. In each case the use of sodium nitrite (100 ppm) alone led to deposition of polymer in 72 hours, but when sodium nitrite (100 ppm) and tri-n-butyl phosphate (0.5 wt. percent) were added, the test solution remained clear 72 hours later.
Example 8
70 parts of acetonitrile which contained 5 percent by weight of water and 30 parts of isoprene were mixed and, with the addition of various inhibitors tabled below, the respective mixtures were treated in the presence of iron rust at 120° C, and the conditions of the products were investigated.
