AMIDOTHIOL PHOSPHORIC ACID ESTERS
This invention relates to a novel amidothiol phosphoric acid ester, to a process for preparing the same and to a composition containing the same.
More particularly, the invention pertains to a novel amidothiol phosphoric acid ester represented by the formula (I),

wherein R, is methyl, ethyl or propyl group; R2 is an alkenyl group having three to 10 carbon atoms or an al-kylthioalkyl, alkoxyalkyl or cyanoalkyl group having two to 10 carbon atoms; and A is an alkyl group having one to three carbon atoms or an alkenyl, alkinyl, halo-
dies of platns and animals and those which have such property as to move after permeation, but the present compounds have both of the said properties. Further, common insecticides are used in order to directly kill 5 injurious insects, but the present compounds have such physiological actions that when used at less than lethal concentrations, the compounds disturb the metamorphosis of pests and decrease the number of eggs laid by the pests to disturb the normal propagation thereof. In 10 addition, the present compounds have excellent contact-pesticidal actions and show marked insecticidal and miticidal action against pests which are resistant to conventional chemicals.
Heretofore, there are a few reports on phosphoric 15 acid esters similar to the present compounds. Japanese Patent Publication No. 27,356/68 discloses O-alkyl-S-alkyl-N-phenyl phosphorothioamidates, and “Chemistry and Industry,” May 6, 1961, discloses on page 591 O-alkyl-S-alkyl-N-cycloalkyl phosphorothioamidates,

The present compounds represented by the formula (I) are particularly suitable for the control of pests in agriculture, forestry and live-stock, and can most effectively control plant-hoppers, mites, aphids, stem borers, rice stem borers, lady beetles, scales and nematodes. Further, the present compounds have effects on such insects as Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, He-miptera and Orthoptera, and on arthropods, molluscs, filamentous fungi and bacteria. What is to be particularly mentioned is that the present compounds characteristically have a so-called systemic action. Systemic chemicals are classified, in general, into those which have such property as to merely permeate into the bo-
shown below in the test examples. Japanese Patent Publication No. 14,525/67 discloses O-alkyl-S-methyl phosphorothioamidates, but it is apparent from the test examples shown below that these compounds are ex-25 tremely high in toxicity to warm-blooded animals. It has been found that the present compounds are not only high in insecticidal activity but also low in toxicity to warm-blooded animals. Accordingly, the present compounds are quite excellent compounds which can 30 be used safely without any injury to mammals. Further, they are excellent compounds which have no phytotoxicity on rice plants and ordinary farm crops, when used at practical application concentrations.
The present compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared according to the following manner:
An alkali hydroxide, e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, is dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g. an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or methyl cello-solve, water, N,N-dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulf-40 oxide. The resulting solution is saturated with hydrogen sulfide to form a solution of an alkali hydrosulfide represented by the formula (III). The thionophosphoric acid amidate represented by the formula (II) is added to the solution of the alkali hydrosulfide and the resulting mixture is heated while being stirred to complete dealkylation. Subsequently, the phosphoric acid salt in the form of a wet crystal or a viscous liquid is isolated and then condensed with the halogen compound represented by the formula (V) in the presence or absence of a suitable solvent, e.g. an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol, a ketone such as methyl ethyl ketone or acetone, or water, whereby a phosphoroamidothiolate represented by the formula (I) can be obtained easily in a high yield.
The reaction temperature in the dealkylation varies depending on the kinds of the starting materials and the solvent, and is ordinarily the reflux temperature of the solvent used, and the reaction time is in the range of several hours to 10 and several hours. The reaction temperature and time in the condensation reaction with the halogen compound are 30° to 80°C and 2 to 5 hours, whereby a desired compound can be obtained in a high yield.
Several examples of the starting materials used in the present invention, i.e. the phosphorothionoamidate, the alkali hydrosulfide and the halogen compound, are shown below, but it is needless to say that compounds

0,0-diethyl-N-allyl phosphorothionoamidate,

0,0-diethyl-N-3-methoxypropyl phosphorothionoamidate.
Examples of the alkali hydrosulfide are sodium hydrosulfide and potassium hydrosulfide.
Examples of the halogen compound are 3-chloro-l-propene, 3-bromo-l-propene, 1,3-dichloropropene, l-chloro-2-butene, 1,3-dichloro-2-butene, 2,3-dichloropropene, 2,3-dibromopropene, 3-chloro-l-butene, l,4-dichloro-2-butene, y-chloro-(iso)-butene, propargyl bromide, (n)-propyl bromide, (iso)-propyl bromide, ethyl bromide, methyl bromide, methyl iodide and ethyl iodide.

tions like in the case of ordinary organo-phosphorus preparations, into any of such ordinarily adopted forms as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, oil sprays, dusts, aerosols, fumigants and granules for soil application and seed-coating. Thus, the present com- 5 pounds can be used in any required forms. Further, the present compounds may be used in admixture with one or more of other chemicals and fertilizers to make the effects thereof broader and higher. For example, the compounds are mixed with organo-phosphorus type in- 10 secticides such as Sumithion (registered trade name for an insecticide produced by Sumitomo Chemical Co.; the same shall apply hereinafter) and Dimethoate, py-rethroid type insecticides such as allethrin and phthalthrin, organo-chlorine type insecticides such as 15 BHC and DDT, carbamate type insecticides such as 3,-
4-dimethylphenyl-N-methylcarbamate,	2-sec-
butylphenyl-N-methylcarbamate, 3-methylphenyl-N-methylcarbamate and 1-naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate, synergists, repellants, attractants and the like, whereby 20 multi-purpose compositions can be prepared and, depending on the combinations, synergistic effects can also be expected.
In order to clarify the prominent characteristics and effects of the present compounds, typical test results 25 are shown in the test examples set forth below.
In the test examples, the present compounds are represented by the aforesaid exemplification numbers.

Lethal effects (contact poison):
Mottled kidney bean plants at the two-leaves stage, which had elapsed 20 days after sowing, were parasitized with a larger number of adults of twospotted red spiders (Tetranychus telarius). The kidney bean 35 leaves parasitized with said spiders were immersed for 1 minute in a solution formed by diluting with water each of the present compounds in the form of wettable powders. Subsequently, water was supplied so as not to wither the leaves. After 48 hours, 40 the alive and dead of the spiders were observed by means of a magnifying glass and, from the mortality, the value of LC50 was calculated according to the Finney’s simplified iconography.

Synthesis of compound (1):
11.2	g of potassium hydroxide was dissolved in 100 ml of methyl cellosolve, and the resulting solution was saturated under cooling with hydrogen sulfide to prepare a methyl cellosolve solution of potassium hydro sulfide. To this solution was added at room temperature 36.2 g of 0,b-dimethyI-N-allyl phos-phorothionoamidate, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 95° to 100°C for 5 hours.
Subsequently, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the residue was mixed with acetone and freed from insolubles, and then the acetone was removed under reduced pressure. Thereafter, the residue! was dissolved in water and then washed with toluene. From the aqueous layer, water was removed under re-! duced pressure to obtain 40.2 g of potassium o-methyl-N-allyl phosphorothioamidate in the form of a pale yellow viscous liquid.
10.3	g of this salt was dissolved in 50 ml of methyl alcohol, and the resulting solution was charged with 7.5 g of methyl iodide and stirred at 50° to 55° C for 1 hour.' Subsequently, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, the residue was charged with water and chloroform, and the chloroform layer was drid with anhydrous sodium sulfate. Thereafter, the chloroform was removed under reduced pressure to obtain 8.7 g of 0,S-diemthyl-N-allyl phosphorothioamidate in the form of a pale yellow oil, n025 1.5032.
