FORMATION OF HIGHLY REACTIVE FORM OF PHOSPHORUS PENTASULFIDE
SUBJECT MATTER OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of highly reactive phosphorus pentasulfide.
Phosphorus pentasulfide (P4S10) is manufactured commercially by reacting phosphorus and sulfur in approximately stoichiometric proportions. The crude product may be distilled and the liquid P4S10 poured into molds, drums, or other containers or cast in a thin film on a cold surface for solidification. Inasmuch as the rate of cooling in the first instance is noncontrolla-ble, the product obtained is of variable reactivity. P4S10 on the outer periphery has a different rate of reactivity than the product in the inner portion of the container. In the second case, because of the more rapid cooling rate the resultant P4S10 is comparably more reactive.
U.S. Pat. No. 3,023,086 discloses a process for controlling the reactivity of P4S10 by adjusting the cooling rate of molten P4S10 through the phase transition range of 260° to 280° centigrade. Thus P4S10 is prepared, distilled, and cooled at a controlled rate through the aforementioned transition temperature range. This process while effective requires, on commercial scale, the controlled cooling of the molten P4Si0 in relatively thin sheets and subsequent pulverization of product produced.
Phosphorus pentasulfide products of lesser reactivity than that produced by the aforementioned process can, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,146,069, be prepared by annealing the P4SI0 after initial cooling. Such annealed products are acceptable for use in applications wherein a more highly reactive form of P4Sn, may not be required.
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION
It is a principal object of the present invention to devise a process for the preparation of phosphorus pentasulfide in a form which is more highly reactive than that obtained by prior art procedures.
Another object is to devise a process for the preparation of phosphorus pentasulfide in highly reactive forms directly from crude material.
Other objects will be apparent from the following description of the invention.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The process of the present invention broadly comprises the steps of forming a mixture of a heated inert gas and vapors of phosphorus pentasulfide and directing the resultant mixture of inert gas and vapors of phosphorus pentasulfide into an area wherein the phosphorus pentasulfide is rapidly cooled and condensed in highly reactive form.
The process of the invention can be carried out in a continuous or batchwise manner.
The inert gas used in this process can be any gaseous substance which does not react with the phosphorus pentasulfide under the conditions of this process. As typical examples of such inert gases nitrogen, carbon dioxide, fluoro-carbons such as trichloromo-nofluoromethane, helium, neon and argon are mentioned. Nitrogen because of its general availability and low cost is preferred.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
In accordance with a preferred mode of carrying out this invention, a body of phosphorus pentasulfide, which may be in a crude or distilled form, is charged to a suitable vessel wherein the material is melted by heating to and maintained at about 425° to about 500° centigrade. A stream of inert gas, preferably nitrogen, which had been preheated to about 350° to 500° centigrade is introduced into the vapors of P4S10 at a point above or remote from the level of the molten phosphorus pentasulfide. The mixture of gas and vapors of phosphorus pentasulfide entrained in the gas is directed into a tower wherein the vapors are rapidly cooled to below their solidification point and thusly condensed to a powder which drops to the bottom of the tower and can be periodically discharged therefrom. Preferably, the hot gaseous mixture is contacted with a stream of the same or other inert gas which is preferably at below about 100° centigrade and especially at below about 25° centigrade, introduced into the tower at the upper portion thereof, to assist in the condensation of the vapors of P4Si0. The inert gas is exited from the tower preferably through a means for removing entrained particles of phosphorus pentasulfide which may be a baffle, scrubber, filter, cyclone, condenser or the like, and the inert gas is preferably directed back through the preheater to the vessel containing the molten phosphorus pentasulfide. Any residual P4Sio would thus be returned to the process avoiding air pollution or product loss.
The process can be carried out at atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressure, for example between about 200 and 300 mm Hg absolute pressure. The mixture of inert gas and vapors of P4Si0 can be formed in any convenient manner. Thus the inert gas can be directed over molten P4Si0 or sparged into the molten P4S10 or the P4S10 may be distilled in vacuo and the resultant vapors admixed with the inert gas, prior to entry of the vapors into the tower.
The cooling of the mixture or inert gas and vapors of P4S10 is accomplished in a tower, condenser, “barn” or analogous equipment. The tower may be cooled externally or internally to expedite the heat transfer, and the tower may contain deflectors or other appurtanances to distribute the gas stream, filters to remove solid particles of P4S10 from the gas stream, scrapers to remove condensed particles of P4Si0 from the walls of the tower or condenser, and the like.
The reactivity of the phosphorus pentasulfide can be determined by a modification of the procedure disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,023,086, Example 1. Because of the hyperreactivity of the product of this invention, an alcohol of lesser reactivity than ethanol is used. In this instance n-hexanol is used. The test procedure is as follows:
One hundred eleven grams of phosphorus pentasulfide are charged to a dry stoppered Dewar flask, equipped with stirrer, vent, thermometer, and dropping funnel. To the P4Si0, at ambient temperature, 186 grams of cool (45° Fahrenheit) n-hexanol are rapidly added, and the mixture is agitated at 420 rpm. The temperature is recorded at 1 minute intervals until a marked decrease in the rate of temperature rise is noted. The temperature is thereafter recorded at 2-3 minute intervals until a peak temperature is noted. The profile of the temperature versus time is plotted and the

form of the curve compared with a similar curve obtained using flaked P4S10, ground to a particle size of 100 percent passing through a 20 mesh screen prepared according to U.S. Pat. No. 3,023,086, as a control.
The following examples illustrate the process of the present invention. Parts and percentages are by weight and temperatures are given in degrees centigrade unless otherwise indicated.
EXAMPLE I
A stream of nitrogen, flowing at the rate of 3.36 parts/minute was preheated to 451° and introduced into a vessel containing 695 parts of distilled phosphorus pentasulfide (P content 27.99 percent) heated to and maintained at 494°. The nitrogen was passed over the surface of the molten P4S10, and the mixture of nitrogen and entrained vapors of P4Si0 were directed into a tower wherein they were cooled rapidly to condense the P4S,„ as a fine powder which collected, mostly, at the bottom of the tower. The nitrogen gas passed upwardly through the tower through a filter, to remove solid particles, and out the top of the tower, through a second filter into a scrubber, to remove residual P4Si», The scrubbed nitrogen was vented to the atmosphere.
A total of 380 parts of yellow P4S10 (P content of 28.33 percent) was recovered from the original charge. The reactivity of this material, as measured by its reaction exotherm with n-hexanol is shown in Table I below, compared to a control run using flaked P4Si0.

EXAMPLE 2
Nitrogen, preheated to 402°, was passed at the rate of 3.36 parts per minute over 700 parts of distilled P4SJ0 (P content of 27.99 percent) maintained at 471°. The mixture of nitrogen gas and entrained vapors of P4Si0 were directed to the tower as in Example 1 above, and the run was concluded after 250 parts of P4Si0 (P content of 28.19 percent) were collected as a fine powder at the bottom of the tower.
The reactivity of the resultant product is shown in TABLE II below,

EXAMPLE 3
In this run, 700 parts of distilled P4SI0 (P content of 27.99 percent) were heated to and maintained at 438°. The system was evacuated to an absolute pressure of 242 mm of mercury. Nitrogen at 16.5° was admitted to the top of the tower, flowing at the rate of 8.26 parts per minute and a second stream of nitrogen preheated to about 450° and flowing at the rate of 4.54 parts per minute was bled into the vapor line connecting the vessel containing the molten P4SJ0 and the tower. Thus vapors of P4Sio emanated from the vessel and were admixed with nitrogen gas in the vapor line connecting the vessel and the tower. The gaseous mixture was contacted in the tower with the cold primary stream of nitrogen which assisted in condensing the P4Si0 from the mixture. After the collection of 157.7 parts of P4Sj0 as a bright yellow fine powder, the run was concluded.
The reactivity of this product is shown in Table III below:
