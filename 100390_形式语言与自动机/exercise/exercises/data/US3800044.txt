10-AMINOALKYL-9,10-DIHYDROANTHRACENE
This application is a division of application Ser. No. 742,171 filed on July 3, 1968, now U.S. Pat. No. 3,622,630 which in turn is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 631,584 filed Apr. 18, 1967, now abandoned, which is a continuation-in-part of application Ser. No. 526,975 filed Feb. 14, 1966, and now abandoned.
This invention relates to novel substituted 10-aminoalkyl-9,10-dihydroanthracenes which have useful pharmacodynamic properties. More specifically the novel products of this invention effect the central nervous system and have utility as tranquilizers. The tran-quilizing activity is demonstrated in standard pharmacological test procedures employed in characterizing chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine at oral dosages in rats, mice and monkeys approximately equivalent to the latter agents.
The novel 10-aminoalkyl-9,10-dihydroanthracenes of this invention are represented by the following general structural formula:

FORMULA I
when:
R represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, such as methyl or ethyl, or phenyl;
Y represents halogen having an atomic weight of less than 80, preferably chlorine, lower alkyl such as methyl, trifluoromethyl, lower alkylthio such as methylthio, lower alkylsulfonyl such as methylsul-fonyl or N,N-dimethylsulfamyl;
A represents an alkylene chain, straight or branched, of from 2 to 4 carbon atoms; and
Z represents amino, mono-loweralkylamino, di-loweralkylamino, of a monocylic heterocyclic amino moiety containing from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, and containing a maximum of two hetero ring members selected from the group of oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, such as particularly morpholi-nyl, thiamorpholinyl, N-pyrrolidinyl, N-piperidinyl, N'-lower-alkyl-N-piperazinyl, N'-(ca-hydroxy-lower-alkyl)-N-piperazinyl, N'-(w-hydroxy-alkoxy-lower-alkyl)-N-piperazinyl or N'-(co-acetoxy-lower-alkyl )-N-piperazinyl.
Advantageous compounds of this invention are represented by the following formula:

FORMULA II
when:
R and R! represent hydrogen or methyl; and
Z represents monomethylamino, dimethylamino, N-piperidinyl, N'-methyl-N-piperazinyl, N'-(w-hydroxyethyl)-N-piperazinyl, N'-(ai-acetoxyethyl)-N-piperazinyl.
Particularly advantageous compounds are 10-(3-dimethylaminopropyl )-2-trifluoromethy 1-9,10-dihydroanthracene	and	9-methyl-10-( 3-
dimethylaminopropyl)-2-trifluoromethyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene.
Compounds of formulas I and II above wherein R is lower alkyl or phenyl, in addition to having tranquiliz-ing activity, also have utility as antidepressants. The anti-depressant activity is demonstrated in standard pharmacological test procedures employed in characteriz-15 ing imipramine and amitryptyline at oral dosages in mice and rats approximately equivalent to the latter agents.
By the terms lower alkyl or alkoxy where used herein alone or in combination with other terms, groups hav-20 ing from 1 to 4, preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms are indicated.
This invention also includes stable, pharmaceutically acceptable, acid addition salts of the above defined bases formed with nontoxic organic and inorganic 25 acids. Such salts are easily prepared by methods known in the art. The base is reacted with either the calculated amount of organic or inorganic acid in aqueous miscible, solvent such as acetone or ethanol, with isolation of the salt by concentration and cooling or an excess of 30 the acid in aqueous immiscible solvent, such as ethyl ether or chloroform, with the desired salt separating directly. Exemplary of such organic salts are those with maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, bismethylenesalicylic, methane-sulfonic, ethanedisul-35 fonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, mandelic, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzene sulfonic and theophylline acetic acids as well as with the 8-chlorotheophylline and 8-bromotheophylline. Exemplary of such inorganic salts are those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric acids. These salts may also be prepared by the classical method of double decomposition of appropriate salts which is well known to the art.
The 10-aminoalkyl-9,10-dihydroanthracenes of this invention are prepared by one of several routes depending on the nuclear (Y) substituent and the presence of a 9-alkyl or phenyl group. When the 9-position is unsubstituted (R=H) the products are obtained advantageously via the fully aromatic anthracenes which are prepared as shown in the following synthetic scheme illustrated by way of example for Z represented by dimethylamino:

in which Y and A are as defined in Formula I and X is halogen, preferably chlorine.
According to the above procedure, the substituted anthrone is reacted with a methoxyalkyl magnesium halide to give the 10-methoxyalkyl-10-hydroxy-9,10-dihydroanthracenes. Advantageously the reaction is carried out in an inert organic solvent such as an ether, for example diethyl ether, dioxane or, preferably, tetra-hydrofuran at a temperature of from about 0°C. to room or ambient temperature for a period of about 3 to 24 hours. Removal of the solvent and treatment of the residue with water and/or an ammonium salt solution separates the 10-methoxyalkyl derivative. The latter is treated with concentrated (48%) hydrobromic acid to give simultaneous dehydration of the 10-hydroxy group and cleavage of the methyl ether linkage. The resulting 10-bromoalkyl-anthracenes are treated with a di-loweralkylamine as shown above or ammonia, a mono-loweralkylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, N-lower alkyl-piperazine or N-(co-acetoxy-lower alkyl)-piperazine to give the corresponding 10-aminoalkyl-anthracenes of Formula III. The latter useful intermediates are reduced to give the 9,10-dihydroanthracene products of this invention with phosphorus and hydrogen iodide or with hydrogen ane copper chromite catalyst when Y is trifluoromethyl.
Hydrolysis of the N'-acetoxyalkyl-N-piperazinyl products thus formed with for example sodium hydroxide solution yields the corresponding N'-(<u-hydroxy-lower alkyl)-N-piperazinyl derivatives of Formula I. Further alkylation of the N-piperazinyl compounds thus obtained with an alkylene oxide or alkylene halo-hydrin yields other N'-substituted piperazinyl compounds of Formula I.
The 9-unsubstituted anthrone starting materials used as above are either known or prepared conveniently as illustrated by the following outline of the preparation of 2-trifluoromethyl-10-anthrone. Phenyl magnesium bromide is reacted with 2-bromo-4-trifluoromethylben-zonitrile to give 2-bromo-4-trifluoromethylbenzophe-none. The latter is reduced with for example phosphorus and hydrogen iodide to yield 2-bromo-4-tri-fluoromethyl-diphenylmethane, which is reacted first with magnesium, then with carbon dioxide to give 2-benzyl-5-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid. Cyclization by acid treatment with for example concentrated sulfuric acid furnishes the 2-trifluoromethyl-10-anthrone.
The compounds of Formula 1 when R is lower alkyl or phenyl and especially when Y is trifluoromethyl are prepared as shown in the following sequence illustrated by way of example for R is methyl and Z is dimethyl-amino:

According to the above procedure, the substituted 2-(a-methylbenzyl)-benzonitrile is reacted with a me-thoxy-alkyl magnesium halide as described more fully hereinabove to give the methoxyalkyl imine derivative. 25 The latter is treated with concentrated (48%) hydrobromic acid to simultaneously ring close and cleave the methyl ether linkage. The resulting 10-bromoalkyl-anthracene is treated with the appropriate amine to 30 give the corresponding 10-aminoalkyl-anthracene which is reduced with, preferably, hydrogen and copper chromite catalyst to the 9-alkyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene product.
The benzonitrile starting materials used as above are 35 either known or prepared conveniently as illustrated by the following outline of the preparation of 2-(a-methylbenzyl)-5-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile. 2-Bro-mo-4-trifluoromethyIbenzophenone is reacted with a tri-loweralkyl sulfoxonium halide such as trimethyl-40 sulfoxonium iodide in a suitable organic solvent for example dimethyl sulfoxide usually in the presence of a strong alkali such as an alkali metal hydride, i.e. sodium or potassium hydride or an alkali metal lower alkoxide such as sodium methylate or ethylate to give 1 -phenyl-45 l-(2-bromo-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-ethylene oxide. The latter is reduced with a bimetallic hydride such as lithium aluminum hydride in a suitable nonpolar organic solvent such as ethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran to a-phenyl-o!-(2-bromo-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-50 ethanol. This alcohol is then reduced with phosphorus and hydrogen iodide to 2-(a-methylbenzyl)-5-trifluoromethyl-bromobenzene which is treated with cuprous cyanide to give the corresonding benzonitrile. Alternatively, this benzonitrile may be hydrolyzed to 55 the benzoic acid and cyclized with for example sulfuric acid to give 9-methyl-2-trifluoromethyl-10-anthrone which may be converted to products of this invention as described hereinabove.
Either of the two general procedures described above 60 for the preparation of compounds of Formula I may be interchanged. For example, 2-bromo-4-trifluorometh-
65

yl-diphenylmethane is converted with cuprous cyanide to the 2-benzyl-5-trifluoromethylbenzonitrile which is then reacted with a methoxyalkyl magnesium halide to give the imine followed by similar reactions as described above to furnish the corresponding 9-unsubstituted-9,10-dihydroanthracene products.
Some of the compounds of this invention may be present as cis or trans isomers as well as mixtures of these isomers. For example, when R in formula I is other than hydrogen the geometrical isomers may be represented as follows:

The isomers are separated by fractional crystallization of their acid addition salts from a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents such as, for example, acetone-ether or ethanol-ether. Also, a pure isomer may be obtained directly from the reduction of the 10-aminoalkyl anthracene.
In addition, it will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that certain compounds of this invention may be present as optical isomers. These isomers are separated by recrystallization of the optically active acid addition salts, for example the d-and 1-di-p-toluoyltartrates of the racemic free base. Alternatively, a precursor in the synthesis of the products of formula I may be resolved into d-and 1-isomers and the separated isomers reacted further to give the optically active products.
The connotation of the general formulas presented herein is to include all isomers, the separated d or 1 optical isomers as well as the dl mixture and the separated cis or trans isomers as well as the mixture of these isomers.
A useful pharmacological indicator of tranquilizing activity is the production of ptosis in rats. In this procedure rats are examined after oral administration of a test compound at hourly intervals for a ptotic effect and the incidence of ptosis is recorded as a percentage of the number of test animals. Another test procedure for evaluating tranquilizing activity is the suppression of rage in mice. A test compound is administered orally to mice preselected for their ability to exhibit rage episodes during footshock and the animals are tested again. The percentage of animals exhibiting protection against rage is recorded.
Antidepressant activity is measured pharmacologically by the ability of a compound to prevent reser-pine-induced ptosis in rats or mice. In this procedure a test compound is administered orally to the animals followed at various time intervals by 1 mg/kg of reserpine (i.v.) and the test animals are observed 45 minutes thereafter for ptosis prevention.
The following table 1 sets forth comparative data obtained by employing the above described test procedures for selected compounds of this invention and the closest known prior art 10-aminoalkyl-9,10-dihydroanthracenes.

As noted hereinabove the compounds of formulas 1 and II wherein R is lower alkyl or phenyl have both tranquilizing and antidepressant activity. Thus the compound D in table 1 has an ED5o of 14.5 mg/kg in the rat ptosis prevention test (antidepressant activity) and the same compound B (dl-isomer) in table 2 has an ED50 of 32.1 mg/kg in the mouse rage suppression test (tranquilizng activity). To demonstrate that compounds of formulas I and II when R is hydrogen do not have antidepressant activity, test results are shown in table 3 for mouse ptosis prevention.

dihydroanthracene is employed which is prepared for example from sodium hydride or butyl lithium. Alternatively, methods analogous to those described for the preparation of compounds of formula I above may be 5 employed to obtain compounds of formula IV. Similarly these compounds may be present as cis, trans isomers which are separated by fractionation. Also, a pure cis isomer upon treatment with sodium hydride in di-methylsulfoxide gives a mixture of cis, trans isomers 10 from which the pure trans isomer is separated.
In contrast to the compounds of formulas I and II wherein R is lower alkyl or phenyl which have both tranquilizing and antidepressant activity, the compounds of formula IV which share the structural fea-15 ture of 9-substituent but lack the benzo ring substituent have antidepressant activity but no tranquilizing activ-

Thus, although the parent compound A shown in table 3 has no antidepressant activity, the presence of a 9-methyl substituent in compound B incorporates a com- 35 ponent of antidepressant activity while retaining the already present tranquilizing activity of the parent compound A.
A further aspect of this invention relates to 9-substituted-10aminoalkyl-9,10-dihydroanthracenes 40 which are not benzo ring substituted. These compounds have anti-depressant activity with no tranquilizing activity. The antidepressant activity is demonstrated in standard pharmacological test procedures employed in characterizing imipramine and amitrypty- 45 line at oral dosages in mice and rats approximately equivalent to the latter agents.

The novel compounds of this invention may be administered orally or parenterally in conventional dosage unit forms such as tablets, capsules, injectables or the like, by incorporating the appropriate dose of a compound of formula I or IV with carriers according to accepted pharmaceutical practices. In practice, unit doses of from 10 mg. to 250 mg. administered from one to four times a day are effective.
The following examples are not limiting but are illustrative of compounds of this invention and procedures for their preparation and will serve to make fully apparent all of’the compounds embraced by the general formulas given above. Alternatives and modifications of the general procedures set forth herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
EXAMPLE 1
A mixture of 12.7 g. of magnesium and 56.7 g. of 3-methoxypropyl chloride in 300 ml. of ether is refluxed for 1 hour. The resulting mixture is cooled to about 10°C. and a suspension of 34.3 g. of 2-chloro-10-anthrone in 250 ml. of ether is added. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stand overnight. Most of the ether is removed and the residue decomposed with ammonium sulfate in a minimum of water plus ice. The mixture is extracted with ether, the extract evaporated and the residue taken up into benzene. The benzene is extracted with alkali and then evaporated to give 2-chloro-10-hydroxy-10-(3-methoxypropyl)-9,10-dihydroanthracene.
A solution of 28.7 g. of the above 9,10-dihydro-anthracene in 110 ml. of 48 percent hydrobromic acid and 225 ml. of glacial acetic acid is refluxed for 6 hours.

The reaction mixture is poured into water, extracted with ether, and the extract evaporated to give 1 -phenyl-1 -(2-bromo-4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl )-ethylene oxide, m.p. 77°-78°C.
The above oxide (12.7 g.) in 55 ml. of ether is added to 1.0 g. of lithium aluminum hydride in 55 ml. of ether and the mixture is refluxed for 1 hour. Water (2 ml.) is added and the reaction mixture is filtered to give a-p-henyl-a-( 2-bromo-4-trifluoromethylphenyl )-ethanol.

To the Grignard solution formed with 6.2 g. of 3-methoxypropyl chloride and 1.4 g. of magnesium in 75
ml.	of tetrahydrofuran is added 5.0 g. of the above nitrile in 50 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and the mixture is refluxed for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is decomposed with ammonium chloride solution and extracted with ether. The dried ether extract is evaporated to give the methoxypropyl imine (29 g.) which is refluxed for 6 hours in 100 ml. of 48 percent hydrobromic acid and 200 ml. of acetic acid. The reaction mixture is evaporated, extracted with ether and the dried extract chromatographed to give 2-trifluoromethyl-9-methyl-10,(3-bromopropyl)-anthracene.
A mixture of 12.0 g. of the above anthracene and 18 g. of dimethylamine in 60 ml. of dry benzene is heated in a pressure bottle on a steam bath for 5 hours. The reaction mixture is treated with water and extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid. The acid extract is made basic, extracted with ether and the dried extract evaporated to give 2-trifluoromethyl-9-methyl-10-(3-dime-thylaminopropyl)-anthracene, b.p. 165°-170°C./0.1
